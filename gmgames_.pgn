1.c4 
{The English opening. Fischer loved to open with 1.e4 and this opening move surprised chess enthusiasts.
This opening is a flank opening in which White takes control of the central d5 square. Many times this opening transposes to one of the mainstream 
Queen pawn openings that begin with 1.d4. In order to exert more pressure on the d5 square White can adopt a strategy of playing 
moves like, Nc3,g3,Bg2 which control the d5 square.}

1...e6{This move controls the d5 square and Black will bring out the pawn on d7 to d5 later.If Black can play ...d5 then he can control the important e4 square in White's camp
1...e5 is another great option which allows Black to develop his pieces to active squares.} 

2.Nf3  {White develops a piece and controls the d4-square and the e5-square.White has not committed his central pawns and waits for Black to make a move}

2...d5 {Black follows up with his idea of occupying the d5 square. The reader needs to observe that Black has made two pawn moves and both of them occupy the light squares. 
This denies the Bishop on c8 the healthy looking f5 or g4 squares. The activation of the c8-Bishop is a problem that Black has to deal with. This move has lead us to the 
Agincourt variation of the English opening}

3.d4  {White develops the central Queen pawn to control the e5 and c5 squares.The Bishop on c1 is also activated. }

3...Nf6 {Black develops a piece and wants to castle early.There is something that I have not mentioned so far. Looking at the board again, we can see that the pawn on c4 is hanging and Black has not 
accepted it. This is known as a gambit and Black has declined to accept the sacrificial pawn gambit. To be more precise, this is called the Queen's gambit which usually arises with moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 
Here Black has many choices on move 2. One option is to play 2...c6 which is called Slav defense. 2...e6 is called the Queen's Gambit declined or QGD
2...dxc4 is called Queen's gambit accepted or QGA. 
This gambit actually does not lead to a loss of pawn if Black decides to play ...dxc4 because White can then play Qa4+ followed by Qxc4
In the game,Black refused to play ...dxc4 because then White can reply with e4! and have a nice central pawn duo. Again after playing e4, White would have the option of playing Bxc4 on the 
next move developing a piece.}

4.Nc3 {White develops  a piece and exerts more control over the central e4 and d5 squares.The d5 Black pawn is now attacked twice
Here White and Black have both demonstrated the classical chess principles of opening play - centre control and development of pieces
The opening has now transposed into the Queen's Gambit declined.In the QGD, Black aims to have control over the d5 square}

4...Be7 {Black wants to castle and protect his King behind a wall of pawns.4...Bd6 is not a good move in this position because 5.c5 will kick the Bishop back. More importantly,
White has the option of playing 5.Bg5 which will pin the Knight on f6, a key defender of the pawn on d5.By placing the dark-squared Bishop on e7, Black has already thrown out the option of the annoying pin of the Knight on f6 }

5.Bg5 {White develops the Bishop and exerts pressure on the Knight.White's main idea is to exert more pressure on the d5 pawn.The pawn on d5 is currently defended by three pieces and is not in danger of being captured soon.}

5...0-0 {A primary prescription of chess opening theory is castling that safeguards the King.Black has completed the development of his Kingside pieces and the Rook is now on f8.Black's next worry is to 
complete the development of his Queenside pieces and control the centre.}
 
6.e3  {White fortifies the pawn on d4 and opens up the f1-c4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on f1.White has to continue developing his army.It is important to note here that 
White developed the c1 Bishop first and then played e3 which does not lock in the Bishop on c1}

6...h6 {This move is called putting the question to the Bishop.Black wants White to take an immediate decision 
vis-à-vis the Bishop on g5. }

7.Bh4 {Masters love the Bishop pair and Fischer is no different. The Bishop goes back and the pressure on the f6-Knight is maintained.}

7...b6 {An important committment from Black. He decides to fianchetto the Bishop on c8 to b7 and increase the pressure on the a8-h1 diagonal
This move transposes the game into the Tartakower system of the QGD. This system is also called the Makagonov-Bondarevsky system of the QGD} 

8.cxd5 {White releases the tension in the centre and opens up the c-file}

8...Nxd5  {8...exd5 is also possible.But then after ...Bb7 the Bishop on b7 will be hemmed in by its own pawn on d5.Now after ...Bb7 the Bishop 
will be much more active and control both the d5 and the e4 squares.Black is also following another important strategy - Trade pieces whe you are cramped for space
This Knight recapture allows Black to threaten the capture ...Bxh4 on the next move and eliminate White's active Bishop.
It is important to note another subtle point. The Black Knight is now much more active on the fifth rank wherein it controls four squares b4,c3,e3 and f4}

9.Bxe7 {White could have played Bg3 but from here the Bishop would not serve anything great except to eye the c7 pawn}

9...Qxe7 {9...Nxe7 would have been incorrect because then the Knight would have lost its bite on e7.This capture allows the Queen to control the b4,a3 and the h4 squares in White's 
territory} 

10.Nxd5 {White captures Black's active piece and vacates the c-file to be occupied by the Rook}

10...exd5 {Forced recapture and White has simplified well}

11.Rc1 {White follows up with the strategy of occupying the semi-open c-file with the Rook.After the change in pawn structure on move 8 we can observe the following - 

(1) Black has a 3-2 pawn majority on the Queenside while White has a 4-3 pawn majority on the Kingside. 
(2) White's Rook is now eyeing the backward c7 pawn while the Black Queen is eyeing the White pawn on e3. 
(3) The e3 pawn is under no imminent danger as the f2 pawn acts as an excellent defender while the c7 pawn is backward because 
its adjacent friend pawns are on b6 and d5. In order to remove this weakness Black will be looking to push ...c5.Another important strategy goes like this - Whenever you have a Queenside majority try and push the pawns to gain a space advantage.Likewise, if you have Kingside pawn majority try and 
push the pawns on that flank to gain space and squeeze your oppponent. Since White's King is still stuck in the centre, the pawn push on the Kingside would be dangerous while Black can take advantage of the fact that his King is safe on the g8 square and start pushing his Queenside pawns}

11...Be6 {Wait a second. Weren't we expecting ...Bb7 now after Black had moved ...b6 on move move 7? This move makes perfect sense as the Bishop is now guarding the pawn on d5.Also the g4 and f5 squares are under vigil
Also Black realises that the d5 pawn will need adequate support in allowing him to carry out the strategy of pushing ...c5 followed by ...c4 and  gain space on the Queenside as 
11...c5? 12.dxc5 bxc5 13.Qxd5 will win a pawn for White. Hence the preparatory ...Be6 to support the pawn on d5 before Black starts his ...c5 idea.
It is important for the reader to note that ideas are flexible and plans are changed to suit the position. Here Spassky has just taught us another subtle insight in chess opening}

12.Qa4 {It is difficult to spot White's idea here. White perhaps wants to push b4 and counter Black's ...c5 pawn push}

12...c5 {Black does not allow White to build any further pressure and wants to remove the weakness from his position.12...a5 in order to prevent 13.b4 was also perfectly playable.Not only has Black struck in the centre but also tamed the White's Rook influence on c1 as it has no longer any influence on the c6 and the c7 squares}

13.Qa3 {Now it is clear that White played Qa4 earlier to execute this move. The pawn on c5 is attacked and more importantly it is pinned against the Queen on e7.White is aiming to tame Black's Queenside majority and nullify his advantage there}

13...Rc8 {Adding further protection to the pawn on c5 as it was attacked thrice. 13...Nd7?! looks unsound because 14.Bb5 will allow White to increase the pressure on the key defender of the c5 pawn.
14...Rfc8 15.O-O will force Black to play 15...Nf6. White can then double the Rooks on the c-file. 
The isolated pawn on a7 will also need constant protection and Black's defence will become difficult as the pawn on c5 will become a target. 
Perhaps an engine will be able to defend such positions but Spassky is no engine and he was playing to retain his world title.}

14.Bb5 {White plays a prophylactic move to prevent Black from playing ...Nd7. 14.Be2 was also alright followed by O-O. 
White realises that the Bishop on b5 can be traded for the Knight if Black were to play ...Nd7. If Black succeeds in pushing ...c4 then the White's Bishop on f1 will 
become a limited piece.Hence White's brings the Bishop on an active square}

14...a6 {Black attacks the Bishop but cannot play ...axb5 as the Rook on a8 is without support.
In my opinion, Black has made a weak move. 
But having said that, the a7 square is vacated and Black can play ...Ra7 that also protects the Queen on e7.
In that case, Black's threat of capturing the Bishop by playing ...axb5 will become real and with ...c4 to follow soon Black would have solved all of his problems. 
A slightly better option, in my humble view, was to play 14...Kf8 that would give protection to the Queen without altering the pawn structure. 
The pawn on a6 is now on a light square and can become the White Bishop's target}

15.dxc5 {White does not allow the ...c4 idea}

1. d4 {The Queen's pawn opening which is one of the two most common opening moves in chess along with 1.e4}
1...d5 {Black replies in a symmetrical manner.1...Nf6 is also equally popular and leads to the Indian defence.}
2.c4 {The characteristic move of the Queen's Gambit. White intends to exchange the flank c-pawn for Black's central 
pawn on d5. If this is achieved then White will have two central pawns to Black's one which allows him to exert more 
control over the centre. This is one of the objectives of opening play.}
2...e6{Black declines the gambit pawn and this move characterizes the Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD as it is known.
Black playing 2...cxd4 is also  popular and is known as Queen's Gambit Accepted or QGA. If White were to capture the 
pawn by playing 3.cxd5 then Black can play 3...exd5 and replenish the centre with another pawn on d5. Also 2...c6 is played 
regularly leading to the Slav defence.}
3.Nf3 {A developing move that exerts control over the d4 and e5 squares.}
3...c6 {This pawn structure is found in the Semi-Slav defence.
This pawn structure is a mixture of the Queen's Gambit and the Slav.
Perhaps the name Semi-Slav is derived from this mixture. This is a solid system for Black because he has fortified the 
central d5 square with both the pawns on e6 and c6. He can develop his pieces by playing ...Nf6,...Nbd7,...Bd6,...O-O.
The only problematic piece is the light-squared bishop on c8 that can be developed by playing ...b6 later or even ...b5 after 
eventually capturing ...dxc4}
4.g3 {4.Nc3 leads to the main lines of the Semi-Slav. Here White is intending to develop the light-squared bishop on f1 to g2
and patrol the h1-a8 diagonal. In the Semi-Slav Black intends to play ...dxc4 in the near future and hence the Bishop 
on g2 will be in a position to exploit the weakening of the light squares.Since White is half-committed to play Bg2 soon, Black 
now has the opportunity to play 4...dxc4 5.Bg2 b5 and protect the extra pawn.}
4...Nf6{Black develops a piece instead.}
5.Bg2 {The c4 pawn could have been protected by 5.Nbd2 or 5.Qc2 but White is determined to gambit the pawn on c4}
5...dxc4{Black now takes up the sacrifice.}
6.O-O {White completes the development of his king-side as he now has to play actively to justify the loss of a pawn.}
6...b5 {Black had to play this immediately as 6...Nbd7 would be followed by 7.a4 where White will make it harder for 
Black to keep his extra pawn.If Black cannot keep the extra pawn then the opening moves ...c6 and ...e6 are not justified 
because the whole point of playing those moves was to strengthen the d5 square. Giving up the d5 square without the 
compensation of the extra pawn seems inconsistent and would allow White to take a firm grip on the centre.}
7.a4 {White attacks the pawn formation and threatens axb5 to weaken the h1-a8 diagonal.The bishop on g2 will be alive and kicking 
in that case.}
7...Bxb7 {Black develops the dormant Bishop and also counters the aforementioned threat by reinforcing the vigil on the 
h1-a8 diagonal. To reassess the position now, we can see that White has both the central pawns and also a lead in development.
Black has an extra pawn to hide his lag in development.The position is fairly equal and White needs to work harder to 
justify his choice of plan.Black's king-side is still under-developed and he needs two moves more to castle on the 
king-side and develop his pieces.Since the Black king is still stuck in the centre White needs to open up lines that will 
keep Black occupied and deny his King any semblance of safety on e8.}
8.Ne5{White takes the above ideas into consideration and decides to keep Black pre-occupied with other headaches.
This move attacks the weak pawn on c6 and White is threatening to play 9.axb5 to pile up pressure on the c6 pawn as the 
Bishop on g2 will be a force to reckon with.If Black plays 8...Nd5 to shield the c6 pawn then 9.e4! will kick the knight allowing 
White to have a firm grip on the centre.}
8...Qb6{Black defends the bishop on b7 as 9.axb5 cxb5 will deny White's bishop on g2 from having free lunch on b7.
Another possible move for Black would have been 8...a6 to add more support to the b5 pawn.Then 9.axb5 axb5 10.Rxa8 Bxa8 11.Nc3 
will allow White to attack the b5 pawn and not allow Black to develop his pieces easily on the king-side.}
9.b3!? {White attacks the pawn on c4 and threatens to win the extra pawn after 10.bxc4 bxc4 11.Nxc4. It is instructive to 
note that GM Khalifman is keeping Black occupied with threats and does not allow more important things like the development of the 
pieces.}
9...cxb3 {This is forced or else White regains the extra pawn with more activity.}
10.Qxb3 {White not only exchanges the pawn but also exerts more pressure on the b5 pawn.
Now 11.Na3 will allow White to attack the b5 pawn further.White is relentless in his execution.}
10...Nbd7? *{Black makes an error and is looking to swap the knight on e5. It would have been wiser to prepare for 
short castling by playing 10...Be7 11.Na3 O-O 12. Nac4 Qxd4 13.Bb2 with a great initiative for White.10...Qxd4 }

1. Nf3 {The Reti Opening.A flexible move that does not commit the pawn structure to adopt. White can play 
2.d4 or 2.e4 or even 2.c4 depending up Black's response} 1...d6 {White's first move prevented Black from playing 1...e5
So Black prepares to play ...e5 later by this pawn move.}
2. g3 {White decides to fianchetto his light-squared bishop to g2 and control the h1-a8 diagonal.The downside of this move is that 
if White were to play O-O later and the bishop on g2 were to get exchanged then the light squares f3,g2 and h3 in front of the 
king would become weak.}
2...e5 {Black plays according to the plan on move 1 and controls the dark square in the centre d4}
3. Bg2 {White's bishop will exert pressure on the light squares e4 and d5 in the centre and White is using pieces to stake equal claim in the centre}
3...f5 {Another pawn move by Black, this time controlling the e4 square.Black is trying to combat the light square control by White}
4. c4 {White is now controlling the d5 square.White has not only developed his kingside pieces but also staking claim on the central light squares}
4...Nf6 {Black no only develops a piece but also counters White's aim to control the d5 square}
5. b4 !? {An interesting move that declares White's intention to expand on the queenside.This move also allows White to 
fianchetto the dark-squared bishop to b2. This saves White future tempi of playing a3 or c3 to play b4.Another good response would have been 5.Nc3}  
5...e4 ?! {Black expands further in the centre and nullifies White's influence on the h1-a8 diagonal.
This move was not necessary as Black played the first two moves to occupy e5 and now has given up that achievement to give White's knight 
a kick}
6. Nd4 {White keeps his knight on the central square}
6...d5 {Black now solidifies his hold on the light square e4 but has made too many pawn moves}
7. cxd5 {White is ahead in development and now exchanges the flank c-pawn for the central pawn on d5}
7...Nxd5 {Black captured with the intention of attacking the b4 pawn twice. Also possible was 7...Qxd5
