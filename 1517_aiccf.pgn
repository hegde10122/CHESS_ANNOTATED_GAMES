1. d4 d5 {The Queen's pawn game where both sides have planted their d-pawns on optimal squares and  control two squares in the enemy camps}

2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit} 2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit declined or QGD}
 
3. Nc3 {White develops the Knight and controls e4 and the d5 squares}

3...Nf6 {More protection to the d5 square}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation of the QGD}

4...exd5 5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation or the Positional variation}

5...Bb4 {Black pins the Knight and removes White's control over the e4 square.
5...c6 and 5...Be7 are also solid alternatives played} 

6.e3 {It is imperative for WHite to start developing the Kingside. This move frees the King's Bishop's path}

6...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

7.Bd3 {Denying the f5 square for his Black counterpart on c8. 7.Be2 looks more timid in comparison}

7...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

8.Bh4 {The Bishop retreats keeping the pin intact}

8...c6 {Solidifying the central d5 square}

9.Nge2 {White does not allow 9.Nf3 Bg4 with an annoying pin.Instead White develops the Knight onto a gentler square and keeps the options of playing f3,e4 or even f4 later gaining space on the Kingside
Also ...Bxc3 can be met with Nxc3 with no weaknesses}

9...Be7 {Black wastes a tempo and unpins the Knight. That is why 5...Be7 was better as the pin on the c3 Knight does not achieve anything concrete 
in this positional variation of the QGD. 9...Nbd7 lending support was a playable alternative Also 9...Re8 would have brought the Rook on the semi-open e-file}

10.O-O {White completes the development on the Kingside and activates the Rook}

10...Bg4?! {Not a good square for the Bishop as it will get kicked again, the Knight on e2 being pinned not withstanding. 10...Nbd7 or 10...Re8 was better}

11.f3 {Vacating the f2 square for the dark-squared Bishop to come back and also preparing e4 at a later stage. The Black Bishop is attacked and Black has to waste yet another move here}

11...Be6* {The Bishop could have also gone back to c8 considering the fact that White can now play Nf4 and harass the Bishop again}

1.d4 d5 {The Queen pawn's game}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit} 

2...c6 {Black responds with the Slav and declines the gambit} 

3.Nf3 Nf6 {All moves according to standard theory}

4.e3 {Black's main idea in the Slav is to play ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 creating an impregnable pawn mass on the light squares.This move protects the 
pawn on c4 and paves the way for the development of the Bishop on f1}

4...Bf5 {Black opts to put the Bishop out of the pawn chain before playing ...e6 at some point}

5.Nc3 {Simple development}

5...a6!? {Interesting move that aims to play ...b5 at some point and go for a Queenside expansion. 5...e6 was perhaps junked because of 6.Nh4 Bg6 
7.Nxg6 hxg6 where Black gets the half-open h-file as compensation for the loss of the Bishop pair and double pawns on the g-file. This is playable but Black 
plays solidly looking for a grind.This move looks like a hybrid between ...a6 Slav and a normal Slav.}

6.Qb3 {Attacking the pawn on b7. Taking advantage of the fact as the Bishop has left the c8 square}

6...b5 {One of the better ways to save the pawn on b7. 6...Ra7 is also playable but then the Rook will have a hard time finding a meaningful square later}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical response from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's Gambit}

2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is on the board}

3.Nc3 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on the d5 pawn.}

3...Nf6 {Black protects the d5 pawn further}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {4...Nxd5 is also a playable option that does not allow the annoying pin on g5}

5.Bg5 {The positional variation or the Carlsbad variation where the Knight is pinned and pressure applied on the d5 pawn}

5...c6 {A solid response protecting the pawn on d5.}

6.Qc2 {The Reshevsky variation where the main idea is to make life of the Bishop on c8 difficult. This move robs the f5 square}

6...Bd6 {The Bishop comes out on a nice diagonal and O-O is now possible on the next move}

7.e3 {Opening the diagonal for the King's Bishop}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

8.Bd3 {The Bishop-Queen battery on the b1-h7 diagonal looks excellent}

8...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

9.Bh4 {The Bishop goes back with the pin intact}

9...Re8 {A solid move occupying the semi-open e-file} 

10.Nge2 {White does not want to allow 10.Nf3 Bg4 with a nagging pin.White prepares to castle short}

10...b6 {A nifty move that allows Black to play ...Ba6!? and look forward to an exchange of Bishops}

11.a3 { White prepare b4 with a Queenside expansion.
11.O-O?  would be a terrible mistake. 11...Bxh2+ 12.Kxh2 Ng4+ 13.Kg1 Qxh4 If 12.Kh1 then 12...Bd6 and White will be a pawn down for nothing}

11...Bb7 {In my opnion this is the worst square for the Bishop as the pawns on c6 and d5 block its activity. 
11...a5 was perhaps better to avert White's b4 pawn advance}

12.O-O* {White can now castle as 12...Bxh2? will not longer work. 13.Kxh2 Ng4+ 14.Kh3! protecting the Bishop on h4. Black's Bishop is no longer on c8 and the Knight on g4 
has to retreat back}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence is on the board}

2.d4 d5 {White grabs the opportunity to grab both the central squares and control 4 squares in the Black camp. Black challenges White's response by having an eqwual stake in the 
centre.}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation considered to be the best response where White not only protects the e4 pawn but also develops a piece}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation where Black's threat is to capture a pawn by ...dxe4 as the Knight on c3 is pinned}

4.e5 {White pushes the attacked pawn and closes the centre.
This is Black's intention in the French defence - to provoke White from establishing a pawn duo on the e5 and d4 squares  and then attack them.
}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the d4-e5 pawn complex as Black gains space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

5...Bxc3+ {5...Ba5 will keep the Bishop pair for Black but the game would be timid and passive. Here Black gives up the Bishop pair willingly in return for doubled c-pawns as a compensation. Black will also have to deal with dark-square 
weaknesses as the best defender of the dark squares will be off the board}

6.bxc3  Qa5 {Attacking the c3 pawn immediately}

7.Bd2 {Protecting the c3 pawn}

7...Qa4 {The trademark move in this variation where the Queen not only attacks the pawn on d4 for the second time but also keeps a subtle eye on the c2 pawn.}

8.Qg4!? {The best aggressive move where White threatens the dark square on g7 and hopes to wreak havoc.
8.Qb1 is also an idea that threatens Bb5+ on the next move winning the Queen. In this case the game would continue 
8...c4 and White's Bishop pair are temporarily placid and out of the game.}

8...Kf8!? {The King defends the dark squares. 8...g6 is an old idea but creates dark-squared weaknesses}

9.Nf3 {White gambits the pawn on c2 and looks to continue the attack. The acceptable theoretical solution is 9.Qd1 where the Queen goes back as 
White does not have healthy prospects to checkmate the Black King.}

9...Qxc2* {The Queen can come back to e4 with a check and look to exchange its counterpart on g4. 9...Ne7 or 9...Nc6 are also good alternatives for Black}

2.c4 {A new move with White controlling the d5 square with an iron grip! This is known as the Steiner variation or the Anglo-French variation
2.d3 is the beginning of the King's Indian attack while 2.d4 is more conventional move order where White controls the central squares}

2...d5 {Black continues in the spirit of the French defense and occupies the d5 square. 2...c5 is also possible transposing to the Sicilian defense }

3.exd5 {3.cxd5 is also playable}

3...exd5 4.d4 {The French exchange variation has been reached after transposition}

8.O-O {White completes his Kingside development and does not bother about capturing the pawn back}

8...O-O {Black cannot afford to be greedy here.
8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 b5? 10.Ba3! and Black's King will remain stuck in the centre with a dangerous attack to follow}

9.Bxc4* {White gets the pawn back but the pawn on d4 is now isolated. Can Black exploit it?}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...e6 {Horowitz defense. Black wants to avoid the Trompowsky attack after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 attacking the Knight and the game drifts to newer challenges}

2.e4 {White is happy to transpose the game to the French defence}

2...d5 {The thematic response for Black challenging White's central control}

3.Nc3 {Kasparov considers this to be the correct response. This is the classical variation. 3.e5 is the advanced variation and 3.Nd2 is the Tarassch variation.
This move protects the attacked e4 pawn}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation which pins the Knight and again ...dxe4 is threatened on the next move}

4.e5 {White captures space in the centre and fixes the pawn structure. This is the main idea in the French defence where Black provokes White to fix his pawns on the d4 and e5 squares. Later on this 
pawn change will come under pressure.}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain and gaining space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {White puts the question to the Bishop and hopes to win it gaining more control over the dark squares}

5...Bxc3+ {No retreating back in the Winawer}

6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch / Hook variation as it is known. The Queen attacks the c3 pawn}

7.Bd2 Qa4 {This Queen move is the speciality of this variation where the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn.Also the d4 pawn is attacked.White's main counter plan is to attack the g7 pawn by playing Qg4. The Black Queen's ...Qa4 move is 
played with an intention to negate White's Qg4 idea.}

8.h4!? {White opts for a provocative set-up and keeps the option of playing Rh3 later.
White gains space on the Kingside as this is the area he is stronger thanks to the pawn on e5.
8.Qg4 was perhaps the more aggressive response where White threatens Qxg7 and damage Black's pawn structure
8.Qb1 is also another sedate option threatening 9.Bb5+ winning the Black Queen. 8...c4 is played as a usual response to stop 9.Bb5+}

8...Nc6 {Another attack on the d4 pawn by developing a piece.}

9.h5  {White expands further and is keen to push h6.9 Qg4 was more prudent in my opinion}

9...h6 {Black halts the pawn march}

10.Qg4 {At last, the Queen joins the party and also protects the d4 pawn for the second time. The bigger threat is Qxg7 winning the Rook on h8 on the next move}

10...Kf8 {The Black King is the defender of the dark squares! 
Now Black has three threats a) ...Nxe5 taking advantage of the pinned d4 pawn. b) ...Qxc2 and c)...cxd4
10...Rh7 is also a playable move but then the success of the odd position of the Rook is based on 
a tactical shot if White were to make a mistake.
11.Bd3?! attacking the Rook on h7. 11...Nxe5! attacking the Queen and winning a pawn.
12.Qf4 Nxd3+ 123.cxd3 b6 and Black's Rook on h7 looks stupid although Black is a pawn up in this case.}

11.Qd1 {The Queen wisely returns back to defend the c2 pawn and White's aggression fizzles out. 
11.Qf4 threatening dxc5 allows Black to play 11...Qxc2 12.dxc5 Nge7 with uncertain play }

11...b6* {An insidious move that prepares ...Ba6 to exchange Black's perennial problem piece with White's good Bishop on f1.
This move also protects the pawn on c5 that was under attack.
11...cxd4 does look playable but 12.Nf3! Nge7 13.Nxd4 Nge7 14.Rh4! and White gets the pawn back with cxd4 on the next move. 
This would mean that White doubled c-pawns vanish off the board and the Bishop pair 
would give White a healthy advantage although Black can defend with accurate play.}

1.c4  {The English opening. White makes a deceptive start controlling the d5 square. The Knight can come to c3 later without the c2 pawn being blocked.
This opening can transpose to a variety of openings later depending on the move order}

1...c5 {The Symmetrical variation}

2.Nf3 {Considered the best continuatuon for White }

2...g6 {Black is keen to fianchetto his dark-squared Bishop that will control the d4 square and limit White's options}

3.e4 {The game transposes to the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian defence which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4. 
The game is no more an English!}

3...Nc6 {As White cannot play Bb5 as in the Sicilian Rossolimo, the Knight can come out on c6 and control the e5 square}

4.d4 {Looks to be a forced choice as Black will play ...Bg7 later and get a great grip on the d4 square}

4...cxd4 {Excahinging the central pawn for a flank pawn and opening up the c-file for activity later}

5.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}

5...Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn}

6.Nc3 d6 {Now we are into the Sicilian Maroczy Bind}

7.Be2 {A quiet move but solid. White's idea is to create a complex of light-squared pawns on f3,b3. The Bishop assists in the defence of the light squares. The bind on the d5 square will later 
be exploited by a possible Nd5.Also this move enables White to control the g4 square and prepares Be3}

7...Nxd4 {Trading pieces when you have less space and forcing White's Queen to come on d4. White Queen will have to waste a tempo after 
Black plays ...Bg7 threatening a discovered attack on the Queen}

8.Qxd4 Bg7 {Black follows up with his plan on move 7 and prepares O-O}

9.Be3 {White Queen will most probably come back to d2 and create a Bishop-Queen battery to play Bh6 later}

9...O-O {Black threatens ...Ng4}

10.Qd2 {The best move according to theory and practice where White has to waste a tempo to prevent ...Ng4}

10...Be6 {Black is the first to complete development and now the Bishop on e6 attacks the pawn on c4.The d7 square is kept vacant for the Knight to 
come to the Queenside}

11.O-O {White completes his development with a slight space advantage}

11...Qa5 {The idea is to play on the Queenside with moves like ...Rfc8,...a6 and ...b5 where the Queen assists the pawn advance.The move also deters White from moving his Knight to d5 as Black would then exchange Queens}

12.Rfc1* {12.Rab1 was perhaps better where White can push b4 later and drive away the Black Queen}
