1...e6 {The French defence}

2.c4 {A new move with White controlling the d5 square with an iron grip! This is known as the Steiner variation or the Anglo-French variation
2.d3 is the beginning of the King's Indian attack while 2.d4 is more conventional move order where White controls the central squares}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...e6 {Horowitz defense. Black wants to avoid the Trompowsky attack after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 attacking the Knight and the game drifts to newer challenges}

2.e4 {White is happy to transpose the game to the French defence}

2...d5 {The thematic response for Black challenging White's central control}

3.Nc3 {Kasparov considers this to be the correct response. This is the classical variation. 3.e5 is the advanced variation and 3.Nd2 is the Tarassch variation.
This move protects the attacked e4 pawn}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation which pins the Knight and again ...dxe4 is threatened on the next move}

4.e5 {White captures space in the centre and fixes the pawn structure. This is the main idea in the French defence where Black provokes White to fix his pawns on the d4 and e5 squares. Later on this 
pawn change will come under pressure.}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain and gaining space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {White puts the question to the Bishop and hopes to win it gaining more control over the dark squares}

5...Bxc3+ {No retreating back in the Winawer}

6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch / Hook variation as it is known. The Queen attacks the c3 pawn}

7.Bd2 Qa4* {This Queen move is the speciality of this variation where the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn.Also the d4 pawn is attacked.White's main counter plan is to attack the g7 pawn by playing Qg4. The Black Queen's ...Qa4 move is 
played with an intention to negate White's Qg4 idea.}

1.c4  {The English opening. White makes a deceptive start controlling the d5 square. The Knight can come to c3 later without the c2 pawn being blocked.
This opening can transpose to a variety of openings later depending on the move order}

1...c5 {The Symmetrical variation}

2.Nf3 {Considered the best continuatuon for White }

2...g6 {Black is keen to fianchetto his dark-squared Bishop that will control the d4 square and limit White's options}

3.e4 {The game transposes to the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian defence which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4. 
The game is no more an English!}

3...Nc6 {As White cannot play Bb5 as in the Sicilian Rossolimo, the Knight can come out on c6 and control the e5 square}

4.d4 {Looks to be a forced choice as Black will play ...Bg7 later and get a great grip on the d4 square}

4...cxd4 {Excahinging the central pawn for a flank pawn and opening up the c-file for activity later}

5.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}

5...Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn}

6.Nc3 d6* {Now we are into the Sicilian Maroczy Bind}
