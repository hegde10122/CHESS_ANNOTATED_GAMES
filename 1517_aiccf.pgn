1. d4 d5 {The Queen's pawn game where both sides have planted their d-pawns on optimal squares and  control two squares in the enemy camps}

2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit} 2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit declined or QGD}
 
3. Nc3 {White develops the Knight and controls e4 and the d5 squares}

3...Nf6 {More protection to the d5 square}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation of the QGD}

4...exd5 5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation or the Positional variation}

5...Bb4 {Black pins the Knight and removes White's control over the e4 square.
5...c6 and 5...Be7 are also solid alternatives played} 

6.e3 {It is imperative for WHite to start developing the Kingside. This move frees the King's Bishop's path}

6...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

7.Bd3 {Denying the f5 square for his Black counterpart on c8. 7.Be2 looks more timid in comparison}

7...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

8.Bh4 {The Bishop retreats keeping the pin intact}

8...c6 {Solidifying the central d5 square}

9.Nge2 {White does not allow 9.Nf3 Bg4 with an annoying pin.Instead White develops the Knight onto a gentler square and keeps the options of playing f3,e4 or even f4 later gaining space on the Kingside
Also ...Bxc3 can be met with Nxc3 with no weaknesses}

9...Be7 {Black wastes a tempo and unpins the Knight. That is why 5...Be7 was better as the pin on the c3 Knight does not achieve anything concrete 
in this positional variation of the QGD. 9...Nbd7 lending support was a playable alternative Also 9...Re8 would have brought the Rook on the semi-open e-file}

10.O-O {White completes the development on the Kingside and activates the Rook}

10...Bg4?! {Not a good square for the Bishop as it will get kicked again, the Knight on e2 being pinned not withstanding. 10...Nbd7 or 10...Re8 was better}

11.f3 {Vacating the f2 square for the dark-squared Bishop to come back and also preparing e4 at a later stage. The Black Bishop is attacked and Black has to waste yet another move here}

11...Be6 {The Bishop could have also gone back to c8 considering the fact that White can now play Nf4 and harass the Bishop again}

12.Nf4 {Harassing the Bishop again. White wants to play Nxe6 and then after Black replies ..fxe6, Black would be left with a pawn weakness on e6}

12...Nbd7 {Black errs into making a hasty developing move. Better was 12...Bc8. Now White can trade off the Knight for the Bishop and create a weak backward pawn on e6}

13.Rc1 {Improving the position of the Rook on the semi-open c-file. The capture of the Bishop on e6 can wait.}

13...Rc8 {Black improves the Rook's position and hopes to push ...c5 at some point}

14.Nxe6 {Now it is the right time to induce the weak pawn on e6 for Black after the Knight is captured}

14...fxe6 {Forced recapture to prevent loss of material}

15.Ne2 {The Knight will go to the Kingside for more action. Also the c5 square is under the control of the Rook}

15...Nh5 {Black wants to simplify further to ease the cramp}

16.Bf2 {The Bishop returns back as White wants to make the most of his pieces and keep Black's difficulties intact}

16...e5?! {A hasty move to open up the centre.16...Bd6 was idle preparation for the pawn advance.}

17.Bg6 {Attacking the Knight and controlling the e8 and f7 squares}

17...Nhf6 {Forced as the Knight was unprotected}

18.dxe5 { White is better placed to exploit open files.This exchange of pawns is hence favourable}

18...Nxe5 {Attacking the Bishop on g6 and forcing it to go back}

19.Bf5* {A nice square for the Bishop forcing the Rook to go to a passive square}

1.d4 d5 {The Queen pawn's game}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit} 

2...c6 {Black responds with the Slav and declines the gambit} 

3.Nf3 Nf6 {All moves according to standard theory}

4.e3 {Black's main idea in the Slav is to play ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 creating an impregnable pawn mass on the light squares.This move protects the 
pawn on c4 and paves the way for the development of the Bishop on f1}

4...Bf5 {Black opts to put the Bishop out of the pawn chain before playing ...e6 at some point}

5.Nc3 {Simple development}

5...a6!? {Interesting move that aims to play ...b5 at some point and go for a Queenside expansion. 5...e6 was perhaps junked because of 6.Nh4 Bg6 
7.Nxg6 hxg6 where Black gets the half-open h-file as compensation for the loss of the Bishop pair and double pawns on the g-file. This is playable but Black 
plays solidly looking for a grind.This move looks like a hybrid between ...a6 Slav and a normal Slav.}

6.Qb3 {Attacking the pawn on b7. Taking advantage of the fact as the Bishop has left the c8 square}

6...b5 {One of the better ways to save the pawn on b7. 6...Ra7 is also playable but then the Rook will have a hard time finding a meaningful square later}

7.c5 {Keeps the Queenside closed. 7.cxd5 is also an alternative}

7...Nbd7 {Best move in the position as Black prepares ...e5} 

8.a4 {Attacking the frontal pawn of the light-squared complex on the Queenside. This move also vacates the a2 square for a possible Nc3-a2-b4 maneouvre where 
White can put pressure on the backward c6 pawn}

8...e5 {Black wants a stake in the centre and rightly so. The Knight on d7 has enabled Black to play this move}

9.Qa3* {9.Na2 is also a good option where the Knight will go to b4 and add more pressure on the c6 pawn. }

4.e3 {Protects the c4 pawn and prevents Black from executing his main idea ...bxc4}

4...Nf6 {Black plays conventional chess.Develops a piece}

5.b3 {White plays a quiet move and protects the c4 pawn disallowing ...dxc4 from Black. 
The dark-squared Bishop will be fianchettoed to b2 followed by Nbd2 which will overprotect the pawn on c4}

5...Nbd7 {Best continuation for Black as he prepares ...b6, ...Bb7 followed by a possible ...e5 or ...c5 later}

6.Bb2 {White fianchettoes the Bishop according to the plan}

6...b6 {Preparing ...Bb7 and a possible ...c5 later}

7.Bd3 {The Bishop does not worry of getting kicked back if Black plays ...dxc4. Then White can recapture with the pawn}

7...Bb7 {The Bishop develops on the b7 square, a usual place in this flavour of Slav setup}

8.O-O {The King is safeguarded alongwith the activation of the Rook}

8...Bd6 {A usual square for the Bishop in this variation. 8...Be7 is also played frequently. The e5 square is overprotected and Black prepares ...e5}

9.Nbd2 {Here White prepares to play Ne5 soon and block Black's chance of occupying the e5 sqaure. The Bishop on b2 is playing an important role to 
achieve this important advance.}

9...O-O {The most natural response in the given position}

10.Ne5* {Denying the e5 square for Black and the reason behind placing the Queen's Knight on d2 was to allow
the White Bishop on b2 covers the e5 square}

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defence is a standard reponse from Black when White opens with the Queen pawn}

2.c4 {Grabbing more space on the Queenside and also controlling the d5 square}

2...g6 {The King's Indian defence is on the board}

3.f3 {A pussy cat looking move that actually contains a dollop of poison. This move dilutes the Grunfeld defence idea 3...d5 after 3.Nc3. 
Also by taking away the g4 square early White kills Black's aggression wherein he plays ...Ng4 or ...Bg4. This move also serves the purpose of 
adding more steel to the e4 square.White can now develop the dark-squared Bishop to e3 followed by Qd2 controlling the c1-h6 diagonal.}

3...c5 {Black in all probability wants to play the Benoni structure after ..d6. This move challenges White to take a call on the central d4 pawn}

4.d5 {The best reply as White expands in the centre and grabs more space on the Queenside and creates a c4-d5 light-squared pawn complex. The pawn move e4 becomes a 
ripe possibility adding more strength to the pawn complex.}

4...d6 {Opening up the diagonal for the light-squared Bishop onc8. Also moves likes ...Ne8 or ...Nh5 followed by ...f5 are typical ideas for Black in this setup}

5.e4 {White has a great space in the centre and on the Queenside. But this has come at a cost where development is yet to begin}

5...Bg7 {Makes sense as Black wants to O-O soon}

6.Ne2 {This is a positional move that  will take the Knight to g3 or even to c3 depending upon Black's choice}

6...e6 {Attacking the pawn spearhead on d5 and forcing White to make a decision}

7.Bg5 {Pinning the Knight and making it difficult for Black from playing ...Nh5 or ...Ne8 later. If White allows Black to plays ...Nh5 and ...f5 later then Black will have an easy game}

7...h6 {Black does not want the annoying pin to exist and puts the question back to the Bishop}

8.Be3 {The d2 square is meant for the White Queen that will eye the pawn on h6}

8...exd5 {Black alters the pawn structure and removes the wedge  pawn on d5 }

9.cxd5 {9.exd5 is ugly as the e-file is opened and Black has access to the f5 square without working too hard}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical response from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's Gambit}

2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is on the board}

3.Nc3 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on the d5 pawn.}

3...Nf6 {Black protects the d5 pawn further}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {4...Nxd5 is also a playable option that does not allow the annoying pin on g5}

5.Bg5 {The positional variation or the Carlsbad variation where the Knight is pinned and pressure applied on the d5 pawn}

5...c6 {A solid response protecting the pawn on d5.}

6.Qc2 {The Reshevsky variation where the main idea is to make life of the Bishop on c8 difficult. This move robs the f5 square}

9...Re8 {A solid move occupying the semi-open e-file} 

10.Nge2 {White does not want to allow 10.Nf3 Bg4 with a nagging pin.White prepares to castle short}

10...b6 {A nifty move that allows Black to play ...Ba6!? and look forward to an exchange of Bishops}

11.a3 { White prepare b4 with a Queenside expansion.
11.O-O?  would be a terrible mistake. 11...Bxh2+ 12.Kxh2 Ng4+ 13.Kg1 Qxh4 If 12.Kh1 then 12...Bd6 and White will be a pawn down for nothing}

11...Bb7 {In my opnion this is the worst square for the Bishop as the pawns on c6 and d5 block its activity. 
11...a5 was perhaps better to avert White's b4 pawn advance}

12.O-O {White can now castle as 12...Bxh2? will not longer work. 13.Kxh2 Ng4+ 14.Kh3! protecting the Bishop on h4. Black's Bishop is no longer on c8 and the Knight on g4 
has to retreat back}

12...Nbd7 {Black too develops the Knight and both the Knights are nicely placed}

13.Rac1 {Piling up more pressure on the semi-open c-file}

13...Qe7 {Adding more steel to the semi-open e-file and also adding more power to the c5 square. 
Black could have directly played ...c5 and contested the centre control on even terms. It is hard to see the Black Queen doing anything serious on the e-file. }

14.Rfe1 {Improving the position of the King's Rook}

14...g6 {Preventing White from playing Ng3-f5 later and also Bf5}

15.h3 {Denying the g4 square to Black}

15...Rac8 {Improving the Rook's position and looking forward to play ...c5. 15...a5 would have been an active prophylactic move preventing WHite from playing b4}

16.b4 {Prevents c5 with a Queenside expansion of his own}

16...Ra8 {The Rook goes back as the idea ...c5 becomes redundant. The Rook will now assist ...a5 and try to put a spanner in
White's Queenside expansion plans.}

17.e4 {White expands in the centre and threatens to fork the pieces on d6 and f6 after e5. White takes advantage of the pinned Knight on f6
and hence the e4 square is only controlled by the pawn on d5 as far as Black is concerned.
The heavy artillery for Black on e7 and e8, no doubt control the e4 square but White's two minor pieces hold sway over the e4 square} 

17...g5 {Forced. The Bishop on h4 is blocked from pinning the Knight on h6 and White has to act.}

18.Bg3* {e5 is still a threat}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence is on the board}

2.d4 d5 {White grabs the opportunity to grab both the central squares and control 4 squares in the Black camp. Black challenges White's response by having an eqwual stake in the 
centre.}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation considered to be the best response where White not only protects the e4 pawn but also develops a piece}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation where Black's threat is to capture a pawn by ...dxe4 as the Knight on c3 is pinned}

4.e5 {White pushes the attacked pawn and closes the centre.
This is Black's intention in the French defence - to provoke White from establishing a pawn duo on the e5 and d4 squares  and then attack them.
}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the d4-e5 pawn complex as Black gains space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

5...Bxc3+ {5...Ba5 will keep the Bishop pair for Black but the game would be timid and passive. Here Black gives up the Bishop pair willingly in return for doubled c-pawns as a compensation. Black will also have to deal with dark-square 
weaknesses as the best defender of the dark squares will be off the board}

6.bxc3  Qa5 {Attacking the c3 pawn immediately}

7.Bd2 {Protecting the c3 pawn}

7...Qa4 {The trademark move in this variation where the Queen not only attacks the pawn on d4 for the second time but also keeps a subtle eye on the c2 pawn.}

8.Qg4!? {The best aggressive move where White threatens the dark square on g7 and hopes to wreak havoc.
8.Qb1 is also an idea that threatens Bb5+ on the next move winning the Queen. In this case the game would continue 
8...c4 and White's Bishop pair are temporarily placid and out of the game.}

8...Kf8!? {The King defends the dark squares. 8...g6 is an old idea but creates dark-squared weaknesses}

9.Nf3 {White gambits the pawn on c2 and looks to continue the attack. The acceptable theoretical solution is 9.Qd1 where the Queen goes back as 
White does not have healthy prospects to checkmate the Black King.}

9...Qxc2 {The Queen can come back to e4 with a check and look to exchange its counterpart on g4. 9...Ne7 or 9...Nc6 are also good alternatives for Black}

10.Rc1 {Attacking the Queen. A more accurate continuation would have been 10.Be2 preparing O-O}

10...Qg6 {The Queen makes excellent use of the geometry and comes back to shore up the Kingside. Black will be happy to trade  Queens}

11.Qh3 {A better move, I feel, was to play 10.Qf4. The Queen has now moved into a corner}

11...b6 {Protecting pawn on c5 and preparing the insidious ...Ba6 to capture White's good-looking Bishop on f1 to neutralise White's initiative further}

12.dxc5 {White grabs a pawn with an intention of playing c4 later and opening up the c-file}

12...bxc5 {12...Ne7 was also possible where Black chooses to develop a piece instead of holding onto the extra pawn.}

13.Be3 {Attacking the pawn on c5}

13...c4 {Black closes the diagonal for the other Bishop making it harder for the Bishop pair to work in tandem}

14.Be2 {Logical continuation from White as O-O is prepared}

14...Ne7 {It is time to develop pieces!! This move also prepares ...Qf5 as Black would love to trade Queens and remain a pawn up}

15.O-O {White has completed his development and both the Rooks are ready for action.This is enough compensation for the loss of a pawn}

15...Nbc6 {There is no other good move except this Knight development}

16.Bd1!?* {An excellent move that prepares to trap the Black Queen on g6. White has developed nicely and it is now time to do the talking}

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian Defence named after two-time World championship challenger to Alexander Alekhine in the 1930s, Efim Bogolubow.
Diverting from chess, there is a nice story which claims that the

5...Bxc3+ {No retreating back in the Winawer}

6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch / Hook variation as it is known. The Queen attacks the c3 pawn}

7.Bd2 Qa4 {This Queen move is the speciality of this variation where the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn.Also the d4 pawn is attacked.White's main counter plan is to attack the g7 pawn by playing Qg4. The Black Queen's ...Qa4 move is 
played with an intention to negate White's Qg4 idea.}

8.h4!? {White opts for a provocative set-up and keeps the option of playing Rh3 later.
White gains space on the Kingside as this is the area he is stronger thanks to the pawn on e5.
8.Qg4 was perhaps the more aggressive response where White threatens Qxg7 and damage Black's pawn structure
8.Qb1 is also another sedate option threatening 9.Bb5+ winning the Black Queen. 8...c4 is played as a usual response to stop 9.Bb5+}

8...Nc6 {Another attack on the d4 pawn by developing a piece.}

9.h5  {White expands further and is keen to push h6.9 Qg4 was more prudent in my opinion}

9...h6 {Black halts the pawn march}

10.Qg4 {At last, the Queen joins the party and also protects the d4 pawn for the second time. The bigger threat is Qxg7 winning the Rook on h8 on the next move}

10...Kf8 {The Black King is the defender of the dark squares! 
Now Black has three threats a) ...Nxe5 taking advantage of the pinned d4 pawn. b) ...Qxc2 and c)...cxd4
10...Rh7 is also a playable move but then the success of the odd position of the Rook is based on 
a tactical shot if White were to make a mistake.
11.Bd3?! attacking the Rook on h7. 11...Nxe5! attacking the Queen and winning a pawn.
12.Qf4 Nxd3+ 123.cxd3 b6 and Black's Rook on h7 looks stupid although Black is a pawn up in this case.}

11.Qd1 {The Queen wisely returns back to defend the c2 pawn and White's aggression fizzles out. 
11.Qf4 threatening dxc5 allows Black to play 11...Qxc2 12.dxc5 Nge7 with uncertain play }

11...b6 {An insidious move that prepares ...Ba6 to exchange Black's perennial problem piece with White's good Bishop on f1.
This move also protects the pawn on c5 that was under attack.
11...cxd4 does look playable but 12.Nf3! Nge7 13.Nxd4 Nge7 14.Rh4! and White gets the pawn back with cxd4 on the next move. 
This would mean that White doubled c-pawns vanish off the board and the Bishop pair 
would give White a healthy advantage although Black can defend with accurate play.}

12.Nf3 {Simple development as White needs to get his act together}

12...Ba6 {Black wants to neutralise White's Bishop on f1}

13.Bxa6 {13.Rh4!? was an interesting choice threatening dxc5}

13...Qxa6 {The Queen prevents White from O-O now}

14.Qe2 {Offering a trade of Queens as well.}

14...Qxe2 {Black opts to go into an endgame. 14...Qa4 looks unsatisfactory. 15.dxc5 bxc5 16.c4! Ne7 17.cxd5 With this move White has managed to clear his weaknesses
on the Queenside and get a comfortable game.}

15.Kxe2 {Force recapture}

15...cxd4 {After a great deal of contemplation Black decides to open up the c-file. 15...c4 looks great at the outset but with minimal firepower 
at his disposal, Black can face the heat instead. White has easy play with moves like Rag1, Nh4,f4 and f5 to follow. }

16.cxd4 {Another forced recapture. 16.Nxd4? Nxe5! is good for Black}

16...Nge7* {Black brings his Knight out}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence}

2.d4 d5 {The standard position where White occupies both the central squares while Black has managed to attack the e4 pawn}

3.exd5 exd5 {The exchange variation}

4.h3?! {White wastes a whole move preventing Black from occupying the g4 square}

4...Nf6 {Black keeps developing}

5.Bd3 {This should have come a move earlier}

5...c5 {Gaining more space in the centre.}

6.Nf3 {Development and protecting the pawn on d4}

6...c4 {Black gains space on the Queenside and closes the centre. The Bishop on d3 is attacked}

7.Be2 Be6 {White White's Bishop retreats to safety, Black puts the light-squared Bishop on the f7-a2 diagonal.7...Bf5 would have allowed White to gain a tempo with g4 although it does not look good 
at the outset}

8.Bf4 {Another piece developed as White wants to play a possible Nb1-c3-b5 and attack the c7 square. This journey is too slow as Black can counter such ideas easily}

8...Bd6 {Challenging the "good" Bishop of White}

9.Bxd6 Qxd6 {The strong Bishop for White is now off the board}

10.c3 {White opts to solidify the d4 pawn further denying the Knight the c3 square}

10...O-O {Black completes Kingside development}

11.O-O {White too castles and safeguards his King}

11..Nc6 {Black brings out yet another piece and remains ahead in development}

12.Re1 {Improving the Rook's position}

12...b5 {Cementing the pawn on c4 further and Black has expanded well on the Queenside}

13.Nbd2 {The White Knight develops on a passive square}

13...Rab8 {Preparing ...b4. An immediate ...b4 was also possible followed by ...a5}

14.Ne5 {Occupying the central square and vacating the f3 square for the other Knight. Good move}

14...b4 {Black goes ahead wit his plan of expanding on the Queenside}

15.Bf3 {Threatening  Nxc4 on the next move and after ...dxc4 White would win back the Knight with Nxc6}

15...Ne7 {Getting out of the problem square c6.Now White is left with the problematic Knight on d2 which needs to find a secure place for some action}

16.Qc1 {Adding more protection to the pawn on c3.The Queen in all probability come to f4 after White plays Nf1 next} 

16...a5* {Black's mantra is to keep expanding on the Queenside.}

1.c4  {The English opening. White makes a deceptive start controlling the d5 square. The Knight can come to c3 later without the c2 pawn being blocked.
This opening can transpose to a variety of openings later depending on the move order}

1...c5 {The Symmetrical variation}

2.Nf3 {Considered the best continuatuon for White }

2...g6 {Black is keen to fianchetto his dark-squared Bishop that will control the d4 square and limit White's options}

3.e4 {The game transposes to the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian defence which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4. 
The game is no more an English!}

3...Nc6 {As White cannot play Bb5 as in the Sicilian Rossolimo, the Knight can come out on c6 and control the e5 square}

4.d4 {Looks to be a forced choice as Black will play ...Bg7 later and get a great grip on the d4 square}

4...cxd4 {Excahinging the central pawn for a flank pawn and opening up the c-file for activity later}

5.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}

5...Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn}

6.Nc3 d6 {Now we are into the Sicilian Maroczy Bind}

7.Be2 {A quiet move but solid. White's idea is to create a complex of light-squared pawns on f3,b3. The Bishop assists in the defence of the light squares. The bind on the d5 square will later 
be exploited by a possible Nd5.Also this move enables White to control the g4 square and prepares Be3}

7...Nxd4 {Trading pieces when you have less space and forcing White's Queen to come on d4. White Queen will have to waste a tempo after 
Black plays ...Bg7 threatening a discovered attack on the Queen}

8.Qxd4 Bg7 {Black follows up with his plan on move 7 and prepares O-O}

9.Be3 {White Queen will most probably come back to d2 and create a Bishop-Queen battery to play Bh6 later}

9...O-O {Black threatens ...Ng4}

10.Qd2 {The best move according to theory and practice where White has to waste a tempo to prevent ...Ng4}

10...Be6 {Black is the first to complete development and now the Bishop on e6 attacks the pawn on c4.The d7 square is kept vacant for the Knight to 
come to the Queenside}

11.O-O {White completes his development with a slight space advantage}

11...Qa5 {The idea is to play on the Queenside with moves like ...Rfc8,...a6 and ...b5 where the Queen assists the pawn advance.The move also deters White from moving his Knight to d5 as Black would then exchange Queens}

12.Rfc1 {12.Rab1 was perhaps better where White can push b4 later and drive away the Black Queen}

12...Nxe4 {It is time for some tactics! The next five to seven are almost forced as Black gets into a forced endgame where White's positional might is 
reduced considerably.}

13.Nxe4 {Forced.Any other move means the Knight will retreat back and Black won a pawn for nothing}

13...Qxd2 {Foced or else Black would be down a Knight for nothing}

14.Nxd2 {14.Bxd2 is also not effective either as Black would have the same response}

14...Bxb2 {Forking the Rooks. Now Black has two pawns for the Knight and soon White will have two pieces against the Black Rook and a pawn}

15.Bf3 {The most effective continuation as the b7 pawn is attacked. In the ensuing moves Black will lose both the pawns on a7 and b7 but will get the a2 pawn}

15...Rab8 {Protecting the b7 pawn. 15...Bxc1 16.Rxc1 Rab8 is also acceptable}

16.Bxa7 {More or less forced to maintain a slight egde. If manages to push ...b6 then Black will gain an advantage}

16...Bxc1 {16...Bxa1? is bad 17.Rxa1 Ra8 18.Be3 and the pawn on a2 cannot be captured. Hence the capturing on c1 to move away the Rook to the c1 square }

17.Rxc1 Ra8 {Attacking the Bishop and clearing the path to the a2 square}

18.Be3 {The Bishop goes back  to defend the d2 Knight as the Black Rooks will dominate the second rank soon}

18...Rxa2 {Another forced move to gain back lost material}

19.Bxb7 {Another move to grab a pawn back}

19...Rb8 {The comb9ination from move 12 now ends with White having a Bishop pair against a Rook and a pawn}

20.Bf3 {20.Be4 was slightly better as the f3 square could have been used by the Knight on d2}

20...Rbb2 {Black Rooks dominate the second rank and threaten to capture two pieces for a Rook}

21.Rd1* {21.Nf3 was possible only if 20.Be4 would have been chosen}
