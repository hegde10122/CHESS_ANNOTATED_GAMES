1. d4 d5 {The Queen's pawn game where both sides have planted their d-pawns on optimal squares and  control two squares in the enemy camps}

2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit} 2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit declined or QGD}
 
3. Nc3 {White develops the Knight and controls e4 and the d5 squares}

3...Nf6 {More protection to the d5 square}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation of the QGD}

4...exd5 5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation or the Positional variation}

5...Bb4 {Black pins the Knight and removes White's control over the e4 square.
5...c6 and 5...Be7 are also solid alternatives played} 

6.e3 {It is imperative for WHite to start developing the Kingside. This move frees the King's Bishop's path}

6...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

7.Bd3 {Denying the f5 square for his Black counterpart on c8. 7.Be2 looks more timid in comparison}

7...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

8.Bh4 {The Bishop retreats keeping the pin intact}

8...c6 {Solidifying the central d5 square}

9.Nge2 {White does not allow 9.Nf3 Bg4 with an annoying pin.Instead White develops the Knight onto a gentler square and keeps the options of playing f3,e4 or even f4 later gaining space on the Kingside
Also ...Bxc3 can be met with Nxc3 with no weaknesses}

9...Be7 {Black wastes a tempo and unpins the Knight. That is why 5...Be7 was better as the pin on the c3 Knight does not achieve anything concrete 
in this positional variation of the QGD. 9...Nbd7 lending support was a playable alternative Also 9...Re8 would have brought the Rook on the semi-open e-file}

10.O-O {White completes the development on the Kingside and activates the Rook}

10...Bg4?! {Not a good square for the Bishop as it will get kicked again, the Knight on e2 being pinned not withstanding. 10...Nbd7 or 10...Re8 was better}

11.f3 {Vacating the f2 square for the dark-squared Bishop to come back and also preparing e4 at a later stage. The Black Bishop is attacked and Black has to waste yet another move here}

11...Be6 {The Bishop could have also gone back to c8 considering the fact that White can now play Nf4 and harass the Bishop again}

12.Nf4 {Harassing the Bishop again. White wants to play Nxe6 and then after Black replies ..fxe6, Black would be left with a pawn weakness on e6}

12...Nbd7 {Black errs into making a hasty developing move. Better was 12...Bc8. Now White can trade off the Knight for the Bishop and create a weak backward pawn on e6}

13.Rc1 {Improving the position of the Rook on the semi-open c-file. The capture of the Bishop on e6 can wait.}

13...Rc8 {Black improves the Rook's position and hopes to push ...c5 at some point}

14.Nxe6 {Now it is the right time to induce the weak pawn on e6 for Black after the Knight is captured}

14...fxe6 {Forced recapture to prevent loss of material}

15.Ne2 {The Knight will go to the Kingside for more action. Also the c5 square is under the control of the Rook}

15...Nh5 {Black wants to simplify further to ease the cramp}

16.Bf2 {The Bishop returns back as White wants to make the most of his pieces and keep Black's difficulties intact}

16...e5?! {A hasty move to open up the centre.16...Bd6 was idle preparation for the pawn advance.}

17.Bg6 {Attacking the Knight and controlling the e8 and f7 squares}

17...Nhf6 {Forced as the Knight was unprotected}

18.dxe5 { White is better placed to exploit open files.This exchange of pawns is hence favourable}

18...Nxe5 {Attacking the Bishop on g6 and forcing it to go back}

19.Bf5 {A nice square for the Bishop forcing the Rook to go to a passive square}

19...Rb8 {The Rook goes back to passivity}

20.Nf4 {Ne6 on the next move threatening fork}

20...Bd6 {Black allows Ne6 as Black can evade the fork threat with ...Qd7}

21.Ne6 {Forking the Black Queen and Rook on f8}

21...Qd7 {Forced. The Rook on f8 is also saved indirectly as 22.Nxf8 is not possible due to 22...Qxf5}

22.e4 {Protecting the Bishop on f5 and renewing the Nxf8 threat}

22...Rfe8 {The Rook now threatens ...Rxe6 on the next move}

23.f4! {Attacking the Knight now}

23...Rxe6 {23...Neg4 was better}

24.fxe5 {Forking the Bishop and Knight now.}

24...Bxe5 {Forced or else another piece will be lost due to the fork}

25.exd5 {Attacking the pinned Rook now}

25...cxd5 {Recapturing correctly as 25...Nxd5 allows White 26.Re1 pinning the Bishop on e5}

26.Bxa7 {Grabbing another pawn with tempo}

26...Rbe8 {The Rook comes to the defence of his e6 companion}

27.Bd4 {The Bishop comes back and offers  a trade}

27...Qf7 {Black unpins the Rook but it is lost anyway}

28.Bxe6 {White is up material now}

28...Bxd4+ {Black trades Bishops and liquidates further}

29.Qxd4 {White is up material and in a winning position}

29...Qxe6 {29...Rxe6 30.Rc8+}
30.Rc7 {Occupying the seventh rank}
30...Qa6 {Protecting the pawn on b7.}
31.h3 {Waiting move}
31...Qxa2?? {The Queen is on a pawn hunt but gives up the support to the Knight on f6.Monumental blunder.}
32.Rxg7+!!  {The defender of the Knight is removed and the Black King is in a mating net}
32...Kh8 {32...Kf8 33.Qxh6# 32...Kxg7 33.Qxf6+ }
33.Rxb7 {The Knight is under attack and  mate is also in the air}
33...Rf8 {Protecting the Knight but this is of no use}
34.Rxf6 Rxf6 {The Black King will be mated}
35.Qxf6+ Kg8
36.Qg7# {1-0}

1.d4 d5 {The Queen pawn's game}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit} 

2...c6 {Black responds with the Slav and declines the gambit} 

3.Nf3 Nf6 {All moves according to standard theory}

4.e3 {Black's main idea in the Slav is to play ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 creating an impregnable pawn mass on the light squares.This move protects the 
pawn on c4 and paves the way for the development of the Bishop on f1}

4...Bf5 {Black opts to put the Bishop out of the pawn chain before playing ...e6 at some point}

5.Nc3 {Simple development}

5...a6!? {Interesting move that aims to play ...b5 at some point and go for a Queenside expansion. 5...e6 was perhaps junked because of 6.Nh4 Bg6 
7.Nxg6 hxg6 where Black gets the half-open h-file as compensation for the loss of the Bishop pair and double pawns on the g-file. This is playable but Black 
plays solidly looking for a grind.This move looks like a hybrid between ...a6 Slav and a normal Slav.}

6.Qb3 {Attacking the pawn on b7. Taking advantage of the fact as the Bishop has left the c8 square}

6...b5 {One of the better ways to save the pawn on b7. 6...Ra7 is also playable but then the Rook will have a hard time finding a meaningful square later}

7.c5 {Keeps the Queenside closed. 7.cxd5 is also an alternative}

7...Nbd7 {Best move in the position as Black prepares ...e5} 

8.a4 {Attacking the frontal pawn of the light-squared complex on the Queenside. This move also vacates the a2 square for a possible Nc3-a2-b4 maneouvre where 
White can put pressure on the backward c6 pawn}

8...e5 {Black wants a stake in the centre and rightly so. The Knight on d7 has enabled Black to play this move}

9.Qa3 {9.Na2 is also a good option where the Knight will go to b4 and add more pressure on the c6 pawn. Now White threatens axb5}

9...exd4 {Black releases the tension in the centre and removes the defender of the c5 pawn.}

10.exd4 {Forced as 10.Nxd4? loses to 10...b4 11.Qxb4 Nxc5 and Black threatens to fork the Queen and King. White Queen unfortunately has no escape square and is trapped}

10...Rc8 {The Rook had to go off the  a-file as White threatened axb5 forcing Black to capture ...cxb5. But then Bxb5 destroys Black's pawn formation
10...Rb8 threatening ...b4 is met with 11.Na2 and White is ready to play Nb4 himself and pressurising Black's pawns on a6 and c6 with a good game} 

11.Be2 {A quiet move that prepares O-O}

11..g6 {The Bishop on f8 will come to g7 and Black hopes to get a long-term positional advantage by attacking the backward d4 pawn.
I feel, 11...Be7 was better as Black can castle and with moves like ...Ne4 followed by ...Bf6 Black can still exert pressure on the d4 pawn}

12.Na2 {White plans to supplant the Knight on b4 and pressurise Black's weak infrasructure on c6}

12...Bg7 {As suggested by Black's last move, the fianchetto is on and the pressure on the long diagonal will be made}

13.O-O O-O {Both sides castle}

14.axb5 axb5 {White opens up the a-file for pressure on the c6 pawn via Qa6}

15.Nb4 {As planned earlier, the Knight will create long-term pressure on the c6 pawn}

15...Re8 {Attacking the Bishop, Black improves the Rook's position}

16.Re1 {The Rook comes out in defence of the Bishop}

16...Ne4 {Gaining space and preparing to play ...h6,...g5}

17.h3 {White waits }

17...g5 {Preparing ...h5 and ...g4, a Kingside flank attack as the centre and Queenside is closed}

18.Be3 {Development of  another piece}

18...h5 {Black continues with his Kingside pawn storm}

19.Nh2 {Preventing ...g4 with tempo}

19...Ndf6 {Adding more meat to the Kingside offensive}
20.g4 {The Bishop is attacked}
20...Bg6 {The Bishop goes back}
21.Kg2 {A waiting move}
21...Qe7 {The pawn on c6 is up for grabs}
22.Bd1 {Keeping an eye on the g4 square. The Bishop will move to c2 at an oppotune time.
22.Nxc6 Rxc6 23.Bxb5 Rc8 24.Bxe8 Nxe8 25.hxg5 Bxh5. With so much trade happening it is unclear how White 
can convert his minimal material advantage to victory}
22...hxg4 {Black wants to open up the Kingside for an onslaught against the White King}
23.hxg4 {23.Bxg4 and 23.Nxg4 are both bad as 23...Nxg4 24.hxg4 f5 will expose White's fragile pawn structure
23.Bxg5 Qd7 with an eye on the g4 square. 24.Bh4 with an idea of shoring up the defence allows 24...gxh3+ 25.Qxh3 Bf5 
and again the White King remains naked.The move played keeps the pawn structure closed and now Black needs to find ways to untangle
and keep up with his planned aggression.}
23...Nd7* {The g5 pawn was under attack}

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defence is on the board.An excellent hypermodern response to White's Queen pawn opening wherein Black controls the 
d5 and e4 squares with the Knight }

2.c4 {Expanding on the Queenside and controlling the d5 square}

2...e6 {The diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop is now open}

3.g3 {The beginning of the Catalan where the White Bishop will exert pressure on the g2-b7 diagonal}

3...d5 {A better idea is perhaps not to commit the central pawn to the d5 square but keeps it flexible by playing 3...Be7}

4.Nf3 {White develops a piece}

4...Bb4+ {Going for a Bogo-Indian like hybrid where Black has already placed his pawn on d5. }

5.Bd2 {5.Nbd2 is considered placid as Black gets an easy game. 5...dxc4 6.a3 White spends a tempo and puts the question to the Bishop
6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 O-O and Black is doing well. Another line worth considering after 5.Nbd2 dxc4 is 6.Bg2 But then 6...b5! 7.Ne5? is bad as 7...Nd5 is good for Black. In that case 
White can go for 7.O-O a5 and again Black is fine. 5.Nc3 dxc4 and theoretically Black has a good position although holding on to the c4 pawn is fraught with danger}

5...Be7 {The Bishop goes back hoping that the White Bishop on d2 is misplaced}

6.Bg2 {White will castle soon and get a good position}

6...O-O {Black too develops rapidly.}

7.O-O c6 {Black shuts out all weaknesses on the h1-a8 diagonal. 7...Nbd7 was also playable}

8.Qc2 {White too remains flexible}

8...Nbd7 {A nice developing move}

9.Bf4 {The Bishop moves to a more active square.White keeps the option of developing the Knight on b1 or d2 or a3 flexible }

9...b6 {Black prepares ...Bb7 or ...Ba6}

10.Rd1 {A theoretical move that only activates the Rook. The e1 square is left for the Knight on f3 while the c1 square is left vacant for the 
Bishop to retreat back if Black decides to play ...Nh5}

10...Bb7 {Black develops the Bishop}

11.Nc3 {The games continues with active development}

11...dxc4  {Black grabs the pawn and gives up the d5 square}

12.Nd2 {The Knight goes back to capture the pawn on c4. Black threat was to push ...b5 and this move does not allow it as 12...b5?!
allows 13.Nxb5! taking advantage of the pinned c6 pawn}

12...Nd5 {The Black Knight wants to eliminate the Bishop pair }

13.Nxc4 Nxf4 {While White gets back the pawn, Black eliminates White's Bishop pair}

14.gxf4 Qc7 {Till now we are still with theory as the Queen attacks the pawn on f4}

15.e3 {White adds more protection to the pawn}

15...Rad8 {Activating the Rook}

16.Rac1 {White follows suit}

16...c5 {Opening up the long diagonal for lquidation of the Bishops}

17.d5 {White decides to open up the central d-file instead}

17...exd5 {Black chops off the pawn}

18.Bxd5 {18.Nxd5 is also okay. 18...Bxd5 19.Rxd5 }
18...Nf6 {Attacking the Bishop}
19.Bxb7 Qxb7 {This trade eases Black's position}
20.a4{Preventing ...b5}
20...Qc8 {Threatening ...Qg4}
21.f3 {Preparing e4}
21...Qh3 {Infiltrating the Kingside and threatening ...Qxf3}
22.Qe2 {Protects the f3 pawn} 
22...Qe6 {The Queen goes back as there is nothing else to do on the Kingside}
23.b3 {Overprotecting the Knight on c4}
23...a6 {Preventing Nb5}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn's opening}

1...Nf6 {The Indian defence -a hypermodern approach to control the central d5 and e4 squares with a piece}

2.c4 {White grabs more space on the Queenside and controls the d5 square}

2...e6 {Opening up the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop } 

3.Nc3 {Natural developing move and threatening to play e4 on the next move.}

3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence, a hypermodern way of controlling the centre with pieces. By pinning the Knight, Black indirectly controls the e4 square}

4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian where White wants to complete his Kingside development before trying to win the Bishop pair}

4...O-O {The main line where Black goes for rapide development followed by a possible ...d5 and ...c5 planting his pawns in the centre}

5.Bd3 {White continues with the Rubinstein main plan - develop the Kingside and then look to win the Bishop pair}

5...d5 {The most popular continuation where Black himself controls the e4 square with the pawn}

6.cxd5  exd5 {White forces a change in pawn structure}

7.Nge2 {White Knight supports his partner on c3. 
Also White does not want Black to play ...Bg4 after 7.Nf3}

7...Re8 {A flexible move vacating the f8 square for the Bishop on b4. It is a good idea for Black to retain the Bishop pair as White would not have the problem of doubled c-pawns 
that happens in certain variations of the Nimzo after .Black plays ...Bxc3 and White responds with a pawn recapture bxc3} 

8.Bd2 {A popular continuation where the Knight on c3 is unpinned and White wants Black to spend another move to take back the Bishop}

8...Bd6 {Preparing ...c5. 8...Bf8 is a theoretical recommendation as White can still play Nb5 and attack the Bishop again. 7...Re8 was played to aid the move
...Bf8}

9.Rc1  {Halting ...c5. 9...c5?! 10.dxc5 Bxc5 11.Nb5 Nbd7 12.Bc3 and White's Bishop pair are placed nicely on the long diagonals}

9...a6 {Black halts 10.Nb5 with this prophylactic move}

10.O-O {White needs to get get things going as the pieces are bottled up in the centre}
 
10...Nbd7!? {Nice move.Preparing ...c5 again}

11.Ng3 {Controlling the f5 and e4 squares}

11...b5 {Black expands on the Queenside preparing ...b4 }

12.Nce2 {The Knight improves its position and prepares to go to the Kingside}

12...b4  {White plans to play Qe1 followed by Bb4 or Ba5. This move stops both the ideas}

13.Nf4 {The f3 square is now cleared for the Queen. Nf5 followed by Qh3 is an idea}

13...Bb7 {Protecting the d5 pawn Black scuttles White's potent Qf3 idea}

14.a3 {White wants to open up the a and b-files and neutralise Black's pawn march}

14...bxa3 {Black accepts the pawn}

15.bxa3 Bxa3 {Black is happy to accept the pawn sacrifice}

16.Rb1 {Attacking the Bishop on b7 as White wants activity on the Queenside}

16...Nb6 {Improving the Knight's position as it eyes the c4 square}

17.Ba5 {Putting the passive Bishop to work. White wants to trade it with the Knight}

17...Bd6 {The Bishop comes back as Black is a pawn ahead}

18.Nfh5 {White offers to exchange Knights and infiltrate on the Kingside with the Queen}

18...Nxh5 {Black trades Knights}

19.Qxh5 {19.Nxh5 is also okay}

19...g6 {Black does not want the Queen in its territory}

20.Qf3 {Preparing e4}

20...Bc8 {The Bishop redirects itself to an efective diagonal}

21.e4 {White gains space in the centre }

21...Qg5 {Defending the d5 pawn in a novel way. Black now most probably would like to play ...Bg4 and harass the Queen. After the Queens are 
exchanged, Black would enjoy the Bishop pair and the extra pawn. 22.exd5?? Bg4 and the Queen is trapped.}
22.Be2 {Preventing ...Bg4}
22...dxe4 {Draw agreed}1/2-1/2

1.d4 d5 {The Queen's pawn game}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit}

2...c6 {The Slav defence }

3.Nf3 e6 {Overprotecting the d5 pawn and Black creates a pawn triangle c6-d5-e6.Black's main idea here is to play ...dxc4 and then play ...b5}

4.e3 {Protects the c4 pawn and prevents Black from executing his main idea ...bxc4}

4...Nf6 {Black plays conventional chess.Develops a piece}

5.b3 {White plays a quiet move and protects the c4 pawn disallowing ...dxc4 from Black. 
The dark-squared Bishop will be fianchettoed to b2 followed by Nbd2 which will overprotect the pawn on c4}

5...Nbd7 {Best continuation for Black as he prepares ...b6, ...Bb7 followed by a possible ...e5 or ...c5 later}

6.Bb2 {White fianchettoes the Bishop according to the plan}

6...b6 {Preparing ...Bb7 and a possible ...c5 later}

7.Bd3 {The Bishop does not worry of getting kicked back if Black plays ...dxc4. Then White can recapture with the pawn}

7...Bb7 {The Bishop develops on the b7 square, a usual place in this flavour of Slav setup}

8.O-O {The King is safeguarded alongwith the activation of the Rook}

8...Bd6 {A usual square for the Bishop in this variation. 8...Be7 is also played frequently. The e5 square is overprotected and Black prepares ...e5}

9.Nbd2 {Here White prepares to play Ne5 soon and block Black's chance of occupying the e5 sqaure. The Bishop on b2 is playing an important role to 
achieve this important advance.}

9...O-O {The most natural response in the given position}

10.Ne5 {Denying the e5 square for Black and the reason behind placing the Queen's Knight on d2 was to allow
the White Bishop on b2 covers the e5 square}

10...Rc8 {Perhaps not the best continuation in my opinion. Black prepares the move ...c5 which is an important motif in the semi-Slav. 
10...c5 was very much playable and would have helped Black. 10...Qc7 also looks appropriate as the pesky Knight on e5 needs to be removed. But then 
11.f4!? looks like an interesting move for White and the game becomes complex in nature.}

11.Qf3 {Qh3 is an idea to start a Kingside attack}

11...Qc7 {Black Queen adds one more attacker to the Knight on e5. Black wants to disloge the Knight at any cost}

12.Qg3 {White maintains the tension as the Knight gets an additional defender}

12...c5 {Atlast, the freeing move comes up.}

13.cxd5 {Opening up the c-file for the Rook on a1, White goes in for a pawn swap}

13...cxd4 {Black first eliminates the defender of the annoying Knight on e5}

14.exd4 {14.Bxd4?? Bxe5 and Black wins a piece}

14...Bxd5 {14...exd5 shuts the Bishop on b7 while 14...Nxd5 allows White to play 15.Ne4 and threaten Nxd6. The move played is the best choice as 
both c4 and e4 squares are under Black's control}

15.Ndc4 {Threatening the eliminate the Bishop pair}

15...Be7 {The Bishop moves back as Black keeps the Bishop pair}

16.Ne3 {Attacking the other Bishop now}

16...Qb7 {Black increases the control over the h1-a8 diagonal not minding the elimination of the Bishop pair. Black also aims to push ...b5 and ...a6}

17.Nxd5 {White eliminates the Bishop pair} 

17...Nxd5  {17...exd5 blocks the Queen's influence from b7 while 17...Qxd5 allows 18.Be4 with a tempo on the Queen}

18.a3 {Preparing b4 }
18...N7f6 {The Knight's position is improved.Nf6-h5-f4 is a possible idea for Black}
19.Rfe1 {The Rook is developed to an active file}
19...Bd6 {The Knight is pinned but there is nothing to worry for White}
20.b4 {Gaining more space on the Queenside}
20...Rc7 {Doubling Rooks on the c-file is an idea}
21.b5 {Grabbing more space on the Queenside}
21...Rfc8 {Doubling Rooks as planned}
22.Qf3 {h4 and g3 is an idea}
22...Bxe5 {The pesky Knight is removed}

26...Rc5 {Attacking the e5 pawn}
27.Bxc3 {27.Rc1 was also a good option. 27...Rbc7 28.Bf1 Ne2+ 29.Bxe2 Rxc1+ 30.Bxc1 Rxc1+ 31.Bf1 and it is equal}
27...Rxc3 
28.Be4 {The only good move that prevents Black from grabbing the a3 pawn.28. f4 protecting the e5 pawn is a bad option.
28...g6 with an idea to eliminate back-rank weaknesses. 29.Bc6 allows Black to play 29...Nc5 and now the King can remain safe on g7.
White will have a hard time defending the pawn on a3}

30.h4 {The back-rank weakness is eliminated and it is time to activate both the Rooks}

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defence is a standard reponse from Black when White opens with the Queen pawn}

2.c4 {Grabbing more space on the Queenside and also controlling the d5 square}

2...g6 {The King's Indian defence is on the board}

3.f3 {A pussy cat looking move that actually contains a dollop of poison. This move dilutes the Grunfeld defence idea 3...d5 after 3.Nc3. 
Also by taking away the g4 square early White kills Black's aggression wherein he plays ...Ng4 or ...Bg4. This move also serves the purpose of 
adding more steel to the e4 square.White can now develop the dark-squared Bishop to e3 followed by Qd2 controlling the c1-h6 diagonal.}

3...c5 {Black in all probability wants to play the Benoni structure after ..d6. This move challenges White to take a call on the central d4 pawn}

4.d5 {The best reply as White expands in the centre and grabs more space on the Queenside and creates a c4-d5 light-squared pawn complex. The pawn move e4 becomes a 
ripe possibility adding more strength to the pawn complex.}

4...d6 {Opening up the diagonal for the light-squared Bishop onc8. Also moves likes ...Ne8 or ...Nh5 followed by ...f5 are typical ideas for Black in this setup}

5.e4 {White has a great space in the centre and on the Queenside. But this has come at a cost where development is yet to begin}

5...Bg7 {Makes sense as Black wants to O-O soon}

6.Ne2 {This is a positional move that  will take the Knight to g3 or even to c3 depending upon Black's choice}

6...e6 {Attacking the pawn spearhead on d5 and forcing White to make a decision}

7.Bg5 {Pinning the Knight and making it difficult for Black from playing ...Nh5 or ...Ne8 later. If White allows Black to plays ...Nh5 and ...f5 later then Black will have an easy game}

7...h6 {Black does not want the annoying pin to exist and puts the question back to the Bishop}

8.Be3 {The d2 square is meant for the White Queen that will eye the pawn on h6}

8...exd5 {Black alters the pawn structure and removes the wedge  pawn on d5 }

9.cxd5 {9.exd5 is ugly as the e-file is opened and Black has access to the f5 square without working too hard}

9...Nbd7 {Black wants the Knight on the e5 square}

10.Nec3 {Preventing ...b5. Also 10.Nbc3 is possible. But then later the Knight on e2 will have to go to g3. In that case Black use the idea h5-h4 and attack the 
Knight on g3 forcing White to loser crucial tempi in finding a good square for the Knight}

10...Ne5 {Controlling the c4 square. The White Knight on b1 is currently stuck and can become active via a3-c4 route or the d2-c4 route. In both cases Black would love to
exchange Knights}

11.Be2 {A quite move retaining flexibility. White can O-O or will he play something else?}

11...O-O {Black brings the King to safety}

12.Qd2 {A positional move that attacks the pawn on h6 forcing Black to make a decision about saving the pawn} 

12...Nh5 {Black prepares ...f5 giving him a good game}

13.g4 {13.Bxh6? actually does nort work. 13...Qh4+ 14.Kd1 f5 15.Bg5 Qf2 and Black has enough compensation for the lost pawn. White wants the Knight to go back}

13...f5!? {Interesting. Black expands on the Kingside but sacrifices the Knight in the process. Black hopes to win atleast two pawns as compensation and piece activity}

14.gxh5 {White accepts the challenge}

14...fxe4 {Black opens up the f-file while the White King is stuck in the centre}

15.f4 {It is essential for White to keep the f-file closed as the King is stuck in the centre}

15...Nd3+ {Black Knight does not have any pretty square for a retreat and forces White to give up the Bishop pair}

16.Bxd3 exd3 {Black has a thorn pawn right in the middle of White's territory}

17.O-O {The King needs to go away from the central e-file. 17.hxg6 is being too greedy}

17...Qe7 {Not so sure about the idea behind this move. A better alternative in my opinion is 17...Bf5 with more protection to the wedge pawn on d3}

18.Na3{White wants to take advantage of Black's last move by playing 19.Rae1 with an X-ray attack on the Queen forcing Black to lose another tempo with the 
Queen}

18...Bf5 {Adding more protection to the pawn on d3 and connecting Rooks}

19.Rae1 {White goes ahead with his plan and activates the Rook}

19...Qd7 {The Queen moves out to evade the threat}

20.hxg6 {White grabs another pawn}

20...a6 {Black prepares for the thematic Queenside pawn march with ...b5 on the cards}

21.Nab1 {White prepares a3 in view of the move ...b5. Black lost on time}1-0

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical response from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's Gambit}

2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is on the board}

3.Nc3 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on the d5 pawn.}

3...Nf6 {Black protects the d5 pawn further}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {4...Nxd5 is also a playable option that does not allow the annoying pin on g5}

5.Bg5 {The positional variation or the Carlsbad variation where the Knight is pinned and pressure applied on the d5 pawn}

5...c6 {A solid response protecting the pawn on d5.}

6.Qc2 {The Reshevsky variation where the main idea is to make life of the Bishop on c8 difficult. This move robs the f5 square}

6...Bd6 {The Bishop comes out on a nice diagonal and O-O is now possible on the next move}

7.e3 {Opening the diagonal for the King's Bishop}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

8.Bd3 {The Bishop-Queen battery on the b1-h7 diagonal looks excellent}

8...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

9.Bh4 {The Bishop goes back with the pin intact}

9...Re8 {A solid move occupying the semi-open e-file} 

10.Nge2 {White does not want to allow 10.Nf3 Bg4 with a nagging pin.White prepares to castle short}

10...b6 {A nifty move that allows Black to play ...Ba6!? and look forward to an exchange of Bishops}

11.a3 { White prepare b4 with a Queenside expansion.
11.O-O?  would be a terrible mistake. 11...Bxh2+ 12.Kxh2 Ng4+ 13.Kg1 Qxh4 If 12.Kh1 then 12...Bd6 and White will be a pawn down for nothing}

11...Bb7 {In my opnion this is the worst square for the Bishop as the pawns on c6 and d5 block its activity. 
11...a5 was perhaps better to avert White's b4 pawn advance}

12.O-O {White can now castle as 12...Bxh2? will not longer work. 13.Kxh2 Ng4+ 14.Kh3! protecting the Bishop on h4. Black's Bishop is no longer on c8 and the Knight on g4 
has to retreat back}

12...Nbd7 {Black too develops the Knight and both the Knights are nicely placed}

13.Rac1 {Piling up more pressure on the semi-open c-file}

13...Qe7 {Adding more steel to the semi-open e-file and also adding more power to the c5 square. 
Black could have directly played ...c5 and contested the centre control on even terms. It is hard to see the Black Queen doing anything serious on the e-file. }

14.Rfe1 {Improving the position of the King's Rook}

14...g6 {Preventing White from playing Ng3-f5 later and also Bf5}

15.h3 {Denying the g4 square to Black}

15...Rac8 {Improving the Rook's position and looking forward to play ...c5. 15...a5 would have been an active prophylactic move preventing WHite from playing b4}

16.b4 {Prevents c5 with a Queenside expansion of his own}

16...Ra8 {The Rook goes back as the idea ...c5 becomes redundant. The Rook will now assist ...a5 and try to put a spanner in
White's Queenside expansion plans.}

17.e4 {White expands in the centre and threatens to fork the pieces on d6 and f6 after e5. White takes advantage of the pinned Knight on f6
and hence the e4 square is only controlled by the pawn on d5 as far as Black is concerned.
The heavy artillery for Black on e7 and e8, no doubt control the e4 square but White's two minor pieces hold sway over the e4 square} 

17...g5 {Forced. The Bishop on h4 is blocked from pinning the Knight on h6 and White has to act.}

18.Bg3 {e5 is still a threat}

18...Nxe4 {Grabbing the pawn on e4}

19.Nxe4 {19.Bxe4 is slightly inaccurate for White. 19...dxe4 20.Bxd6 Qxd6 21.Nxe4 Qg6 22.Ng3 and Black looks okay}

19....dxe4 {Forced}

20.Bxd6 {White induces another favourable exchange by attacking the Queen}

20...Qxd6 {20...exd3 was also an alternative. 21.Bxe7 dxc2 is complicated and Black does not fancy defending the position without the Queens on the board}

21.Bxe4 {White gets the pawn back with a slight advantage}

21...Nf6 {Attacking the Bishop and also improving the Knight's position}

22.Bf3 {22.Bxc6? is bad as Black uses the pin to neutralise White's advantage 22...Rac8! 23.b5 is forced 23...Bxc6 24.bxc6 Re6! and Black will get the pawn on c6}

22...a6 {Another waiting move}

23.Ng3 {Offers the d4 pawn as a bait and prepares Nf5 to fork the pawn on h6 and the Black Queen on d6}

23...Rxe1+ {Black attempts to simplify the position}

24.Rxe1 Re8 {Another Rook exchange offered}

25.Rxe8 {White trades and wants to go into a better ending}

25...Nxe8 26.Nf5 {Attacking the Queen and at the same time defending the pawn on d4}

26...Qf6 {The Queen goes to a safe square and keeps up the pressure on the d4 pawn}

27.a4 {White begins the pawn march as the pawn on d4 has adequate protection}

27...Ng7 {Forcing White to make a decision with the defender of the d4 pawn}

28.Nxg7 {White trades as the game will be nicer with lesser pieces}

28...Kxg7 {The King is out of the last rank and hides behind the Queen}

29.Qc3 {Protecting the pawn on d4,White wants to squeeze Black's inferior Bishop on b7 by playing on the dark squares}

29...b5 {Black challenges the pawn on a4}

30.a5 {White reacts by closing the pawn structure. The Bishop on b7 is a serious liability for Black}
 
30...Kf8 {What else? The Queen on f6 has to baby-sit the pawn on c6.} 

31.Qc5+ {White keeps a firm grip over the dark squares}

31...Kg8 {The King goes back as White's grip on the dark squares is formidable}

32.Kf1 {Improving the King's position now}

32...Qe6 {Black waits again}

33.Qe5 {Offering to trade Queens}

33...Qxe5 34.dxe5 Kf8 {The Black moves towards the centre hoping to eliminate the pawn on e5}

35.g3 {White needs to prevent the Black King from coming to e6.For this Bg4 is a necessity. Hence 35.g4?! is a bad move that allows Black's 
King to have unrestrained access over the central squares. 
35.Bg4 is also good but it is unclear how White will cope up with 35...c5 which allows Black's Bishop to come to life as the White pawn on g2 is enprise.
35.Ke2? is bad allowing Black to push 35...Ke7. To prevent Black from playing 36...Ke6 White must now play 36.Bg4 which again allows Black to push 
36...c5 attacking the pawn on g2.Complicated stuff.}

35...Bc8 {Attacking the h3 pawn}

36.Bxc6 Bxh3+ {Black needs to activate the Bishop at any cost}

37.Ke2 {Improving the position of the King}

37...Bc8 {Preventing White from playing Bb7}

38.Ke3 {The White King goes closer towards the centre}

38...h5 {38...Ke7 looks better. Black pawns need the King as pushing them further only makes them weaker}
39.f4 {Attacking the pawn and forcing Black to decide his pawn structure}
39...h4 {The h-pawn marches forward but the h1 square is under WHite's control}
40.fxg5 {Another pawn grabbed}
40...h3 {The pawn is going to die a slow death}
41.Kf3 {The White King is in the nick of time}
41...Ke7 {The King is finally out and Black plans to play ...Ke6 next}
42.Bd5 {The only good continuation for White as the e6 square needs to be blocked from Black's King. Any other move will allow Black to escape 
with a draw.Black resigned as the chances of saving the game are slim}1-0

1.e4 e6 {The French defence is on the board}

2.d4 d5 {White grabs the opportunity to grab both the central squares and control 4 squares in the Black camp. Black challenges White's response by having an eqwual stake in the 
centre.}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation considered to be the best response where White not only protects the e4 pawn but also develops a piece}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation where Black's threat is to capture a pawn by ...dxe4 as the Knight on c3 is pinned}

4.e5 {White pushes the attacked pawn and closes the centre.
This is Black's intention in the French defence - to provoke White from establishing a pawn duo on the e5 and d4 squares  and then attack them.
}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the d4-e5 pawn complex as Black gains space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

5...Bxc3+ {5...Ba5 will keep the Bishop pair for Black but the game would be timid and passive. Here Black gives up the Bishop pair willingly in return for doubled c-pawns as a compensation. Black will also have to deal with dark-square 
weaknesses as the best defender of the dark squares will be off the board}

6.bxc3  Qa5 {Attacking the c3 pawn immediately}

7.Bd2 {Protecting the c3 pawn}

7...Qa4 {The trademark move in this variation where the Queen not only attacks the pawn on d4 for the second time but also keeps a subtle eye on the c2 pawn.}

8.Qg4!? {The best aggressive move where White threatens the dark square on g7 and hopes to wreak havoc.
8.Qb1 is also an idea that threatens Bb5+ on the next move winning the Queen. In this case the game would continue 
8...c4 and White's Bishop pair are temporarily placid and out of the game.}

8...Kf8!? {The King defends the dark squares. 8...g6 is an old idea but creates dark-squared weaknesses}

9.Nf3 {White gambits the pawn on c2 and looks to continue the attack. The acceptable theoretical solution is 9.Qd1 where the Queen goes back as 
White does not have healthy prospects to checkmate the Black King.}

9...Qxc2 {The Queen can come back to e4 with a check and look to exchange its counterpart on g4. 9...Ne7 or 9...Nc6 are also good alternatives for Black}

10.Rc1 {Attacking the Queen. A more accurate continuation would have been 10.Be2 preparing O-O}

10...Qg6 {The Queen makes excellent use of the geometry and comes back to shore up the Kingside. Black will be happy to trade  Queens}

11.Qh3 {A better move, I feel, was to play 10.Qf4. The Queen has now moved into a corner}

11...b6 {Protecting pawn on c5 and preparing the insidious ...Ba6 to capture White's good-looking Bishop on f1 to neutralise White's initiative further}

12.dxc5 {White grabs a pawn with an intention of playing c4 later and opening up the c-file}

12...bxc5 {12...Ne7 was also possible where Black chooses to develop a piece instead of holding onto the extra pawn.}

13.Be3 {Attacking the pawn on c5}

13...c4 {Black closes the diagonal for the other Bishop making it harder for the Bishop pair to work in tandem}

14.Be2 {Logical continuation from White as O-O is prepared}

14...Ne7 {It is time to develop pieces!! This move also prepares ...Qf5 as Black would love to trade Queens and remain a pawn up}

15.O-O {White has completed his development and both the Rooks are ready for action.This is enough compensation for the loss of a pawn}

15...Nbc6 {There is no other good move except this Knight development}

16.Bd1!? {An excellent move that prepares to trap the Black Queen on g6. White has developed nicely and it is now time to do the talking}

16...f5 {Black vacates the f7 sqaure for the Queen}

17.exf6 {White decides to open up the central e-file and bring the Rooks into action}

17...gxf6 {17...Qxf6 is bad as the pawn on e6 becomes a permanent backward pawn. White's Rooks can occupy the e-file and create pressure on the e6 pawn}

18.Nh4 {Forcing Black to move the Queen again.More importantly the third rank is cleared for the White Queen to enter the game}

18...Qf7 {The Queen drops back and Black is a pawn ahead but at the cost of losing the castling rights}

19.Rb1 {White wants to infiltrate the seventh rank with his Rook}

19...Rg8 {19...e5 with a discovered attack on the Queen looks like a playable move. 20.NBh6+ Ke8 21.Qe3 and with the idea of playing 22.f4, Black has to deal with 
complications. The Rook move does not commit any pawn moves that are irreversible in nature and also activates a piece on an open file}

20.Bh6+ Ke8 {Black's King can now escape towards the Queenside but the only hindrance is the active White Rook on b1.White still is a pawn down and 
must do something to restore parity}

21.Qe3 {The Queen now aims to occupy the c5 square. White aims to play Rb7 soon and probably f4,f5 as well.}

21...Bd7 {Black needs to his develop his pieces, especially the Rook on a8 soon}

22.Bf4 {Nice improvisation. White wants to play Bd6 and penetrate the dark squares - a weakness in Black's camp.}

22...e5 {Attcking the Bisshop and closing it's prospects on the c5 and d6 squares.}
23.Bg3 {The only good square. The Bishop is cut-off from penetrating the Queenside}
23...d4 {Preventing White from playing Qc5 and f4. In hindsight,22.f4 looks better now as it would have allowed White to rip open the central files.
Variation 1: 23...Kf8 24.Ba4 Rd8 25.Rb7 d4 26.cxd4 exd4 27.Qh6+ allows White a great initiative. This check is possible only because of the King on f8.
27...Rg7 28.Bc7 and White's pieces are all playing a cohesive part in chiselling Black's defense.
Variation 2: 23...Kd8 24.f4 e4 keeping the e-file closed. 25.f5 allows White to establish a wedge pawn controlling the e6 square
Variation 3: 23...Kd8 24.Qc5!? f5 25.Nf3 attacking the e5 pawn twice. 25...f4 26.Bh4 allows White to have a great advantage}
24.Qd2 {The Queen goes back wih f4 on the cards}
24...Rd8 {Activating the Rook as the attack on the Queen allowed Black an extra tempo}
25.f4 {White wants to break the pawn chain}
25...e4* {25...exf4 looks suicidal as then 26.Qxf4 creates a backward pawn on f6. The Black King's wafer-thin pawn cover will prove to be 
counterproductive in the long run.25...dxc3 26.Qxc3 opens up the d-file but then Black will have to push ...e4 as White's threat of fxe5 is decisive}

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defence.A standard response to White's Queen pawn opening}

2.c4 {White grabs more space on the Queenside and controls the d5 square}

2...e6 {Opens the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop and controls the d5 square}

3.Nf3 {Avoids 3.Nc3 Bb4 which is the Nimzo-Indian defence where Black's prospects are excellent}

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian Defence named after two-time World championship challenger to Alexander Alekhine in the 1930s, Efim Bogolubow.
Diverting from chess, there is a nice story which claims that the
rotund Bogolubow was a jovial fellow and knew only one word in the English dictionary - beer!
He also boasted once,"When I play White, I win because I have the first move. When I am Black, I win because I am Bogolubow!!"}

4.Nbd2 {White wants to eliminate Black's Bishop pair later by playing a3 but wants to preserve his two Bishops}

4...b6 {...Bb7 is the idea to control the e4 square}

5.a3 {White spends an entire tempo to win the Bishop pair}

5...Bxd2+ {5...Ba5 is not sound for Black as theory suggests}

6.Qxd2 {6.Bxd2 was perhaps better as the Bishop would have been developed. But White wants to play b4 followed by Bb2 to fianchetto the dark-squared Bishop.
But WHite senses that Black on account of the loss of the dark-squared Bishop will be weaker on dark squares and the Bishop on b2 controls the long diagonal 
giving White a positional edge}

6...Bb7 {The Bishop comes out as planned}

7.e3 {Be2 followed by O-O is the idea}

7...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development}

8.Be2 {White is consisent with his idea. Another active move would have been to play 8.b4 and expand on the Queenside. This move would also have hindered Black from pushing ...c5
White could have then played Bb2 and developed the other Bishop}

8...d6 {Black'a main idea is to play ...e5 and ...Nbd7 here} 

9.O-O {White develops the Rook and shields his King} 

9...Nbd7 {Another piece developed}

10.b4 {White grabs more space on the Queenside and aims to play Bb2 later}

10...Ne4 {Black's main idea is to lock down the e4 square and play around the Kingside. The White Queen is attacked}

11.Qc2 {White aims to play d5 next and cut-off the Black Knight's defender on b7}

11...f5!? {Black adds more weight to the e4 square}

12.d5 {As expected, White grabs more space in the centre}

12...e5 {Black closes the centre and his idea is to play ...c5 later and also moves like ...Rf6-g6,...Ng5 etc}

13.Nd2 {Attacking the thorn on e4 and White prepared Nb3 to take the Knight to greener pastures on the Queenside}\

13...Nxd2 {13...Ndf6?! is not a good idea as White will not play 14.Nxe4 and allow Black to reinforce another Knight on e4. Instead 14.Nb3 controlling 
the c5 and a5 squares will help White to go ahead with his expansion plans on the Queenside}

14.Bxd2 {14.Qxd2 was slightly better in my opinion as it deters Black from playing 14...c6? 15.dxc6 Bxc6 16.Qxd6 only helps White. In that case,
Black continues with 14...Qe7 and protects the pawn on d6 before playing ...c6 later
But the Bishop recapture allows White's Queen to remain on c2 and White can hope to push e4 in the centre. This tradeoff perhaps explains White's 
idea to recapture the Knight with the Bishop}

14...c6 {Black takes advantage of the fact that White does not have a major piece controlling the d-file and attacks the head of the light-squared pawn chain complex}

15.dxc6 {15.e4 is not good as Black has 15...fxe4 16.Qxe4 cxd5 17.cxd5 and White's pawn structure looks messy}

15...Bxc6 {Forced recapture or else White wins a pawn for nothing}

16.f3 {Blunting Black Bishop's influence on the g2 square for the moment. White also beefs up control over the e4 square. 
16.Rfd1 Qg5 17.f3 would have been inevitable. Thus White saves a tempo and keeps the option for his Rooks flexible}

16...Qh4 {Black wants to launch an attack on the White King. ...Rf6 followed by ...Rh6 is an idea}

17.a4!? {White expands on the Queenside. Moves like a5 and c5 are on the cards depending on Black's response.}

17...a5 {Halting White from pushing a5 himself}

18.c5 {White expands}
18...bxc5 {18...dxc5? is bad as White can then play 19.Qa2+}
19.bxa5 {White has a dangerous position and a passed pawn now}
19...Qe7 {The Queen comes back to shore up the defence.}
20.Bb5* {Attacking the defender of the light squares}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence}

2.d4 d5 {White grabs space with the central pawn duo while Black hits back to have his own share of the centre}

3.Nd2  {The Tarrasch variation. The Knight on d2 supports the pawn on e4 and White gives the game a positional colour}

3...Be7 {An exotic variation where Black plays 'hide and seek'. This is a favourite of Russian grandmaster Alexander Morozevich. Black keeps his Knight on g8
3...Nf6 is the most popular response where Black attacks the e4 pawn again provoking White to push 4.e5}

4.Ngf3 {A harmless looking move from Black's perspective. White develops in normal fashion}

4...Nf6 {Black too develops the Knight and attacks the e4 pawn}

5.e5 {Fixing the pawn structure in the centre and gaining space on the Kingside. But Black has achieved on of the key objectives in his French 
defence adventure - the pawn structure d4-e5 on the dark squares that can be later attacked starting with pressure on d4. ANother French defence break ...f6 can be played later to attack White's 
pawn on e5}

5...Nfd7 {The Knight retreats to the Queenside where Black will soon begin a counterstrike}

6.Bd3 {The best continuation for White as he prepares to O-O}

6...c5 {A thematic move attacking the d4 pawn and forcing White to make a decision. ...c4 is in the air which will block White's Bishop from serious activity}

7.c3 {White has to spend a move in protecting the d4 pawn.}

7...b6!? {7...Nc6 is also playable but this move comes with the idea of playing ...Ba6 on the next move. Black would love to exchange his placide Bishop on c8 with his 
more active counterpart on d3}

8.O-O {White develops and activates the Rook}

8...Ba6 {The Bishops will definitely go off the board}

9.Bxa6 Nxa6 {Black has attained another objective - to exchange light-squared Bishops}

10.Ne1!? {A new idea in this position. The Knight can go to f4 via d3 or can even go to c2 for some Queenside expansion plans.}

10...Nc7 {Black Knight comes back to c7 and Black's another idea in this position begins---push ...c4,...b5,...a5 and try to corner White on the 
Queenside}

11.Qg4 {Attacking the pawn on g7}

11...O-O {Defence combined with development}

12.Ndf3 {13.Bh6 threatening mate on g7 is the idea}

12...c4 {Denying the d3 square for the Knight. Now Nd3-f4 is prevented. Black prepares ..b5,...Rb8 and ...a5}

13.Bh6 {Threatening mate on g7}

13...Ne8 {Black has all the bases covered and the pieces are jam-packed in defensive positions}

14.a4 {White begins a Queenside expansion and prevents Black from playing ...b5}

14...a5 {Halting White from further pawn expansion, Black aims to play ...Rb8 followed by ...b5. 14...Nb8 with the idea of playing ...Nc6 also looks okay for Black but then 
the Knight on c6 is not too influential. Black preferes to keep the Knight on d7 and waits for White to make a decision}

15.Nc2 {The action begins on the Queenside as White connects Rooks}

15...Rb8 {Preparing ...b5. 15...b5 is an active choice. 16.axb5 Rb8 17.Na3 Kh8 18.Bd2 Nc7 with a double attack on the pawn on b5}

16.Na2  {White defends the b2 pawn and is ready for a battle on the Queenside}

16...Kh8 {Forcing the Bishop to move back. Black needs to unwind his bottled-up pieces}

17.Bg5 {White offers to trade the Bishops}

17...h6 {Asking the question to the Bishop and vacating the h7 square for the King}

18.Bc1 {This looks like a sub-optimal move at the outset. White overprotects the pawn on b2.The Bishop looks better on d2 as the Rook on a2 will have to 
work hard to get back into the game}

18...Kh7 {Safe King}

19.Qh3 {19.Re1 seems better}

2.c4 {A new move with White controlling the d5 square with an iron grip! This is known as the Steiner variation or the Anglo-French variation
2.d3 is the beginning of the King's Indian attack while 2.d4 is more conventional move order where White controls the central squares}

2...d5 {Black continues in the spirit of the French defense and occupies the d5 square. 2...c5 is also possible transposing to the Sicilian defense }

3.exd5 {3.cxd5 is also playable}

3...exd5 4.d4 {The French exchange variation has been reached after transposition}

4...Nf6 {Piece development aiding the protection of the pawn on d5}

5.Nc3 {White too develops and pressurises the d5 pawn again}

5...Bb4 {Pinning the Knight with the Bishop development and prepares O-O}

6.Nf3 {White develops the King Knight}

6...Bg4 {Pinning the other Knight}

7.Be2 {Development and unpinning the Knight}

7...dxc4 {Black captures the pawn and hopes to create an isolated Quen pawn or IQP on the d4 square which can be targeted}

8.O-O {White completes his Kingside development and does not bother about capturing the pawn back}

8...O-O {Black cannot afford to be greedy here.
8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 b5? 10.Ba3! and Black's King will remain stuck in the centre with a dangerous attack to follow}

9.Bxc4 {White gets the pawn back but the pawn on d4 is now isolated. Can Black exploit it?}

9...Nc6 {Devel;oping a piece is the best option as 9...Bxf3 10.Qxf3 Qxd4 11.Qxb7 Qxc4 12.Qxa8 Bd6 13.Qxa7 Bxh2+ 14.Kxh2 Qxf1 is equal} 

10.Be3 {Development and also providing added protection to the isolated pawn on d4}

10...Bh5 {Planning to re-route the Bishop to g6 later. The pin on the Knight is maintained for the moment}

11.Rc1 {White is bringing his pieces out on good squares}

11...Qd6 {Vacating the d8 square for the Rook on a8. Black begins his pressure tactics on the isolated Queen pawn on d4}  

12.Nb5 {Attacking the Queen. But this Knight will have to go back later to c3 as it has nothing significant to achieve after Black moves the Queen.
Thus White would have wasted an extra move without gaining anything great.}

12...Qd7 {12...Qe7 also looks okay but I feel that it is slightly inferior. 13.Re1 with an X-ray attack on the Black Queen will force Black to move the Queen again.
This move keeps the pressure on the d4 pawn}

13.Be2 {The Knight is unpinned with the possiblity of the move Ne5 to harass the Black Queen again}

13...a6 {Kicking the Knight back forcing White to lose a move}

14.Ne5 {White wants to simplify th positionb by trading pieces. White not only attacks the Black Queen but also opens up a discovered attack on the Bishop on f5}

14...Nxe5 {The attacker is now traded off. Now White's Knight on b5 is hanging but he has two attackers on the Bishop on h5. What will he choose?}

15.dxe5 Bxe2 {Another round of exchanges}

16.Qxe2 {The only recapture that keeps White balanced.}

16...Nd5 {Protecting the pawn on c7 and  forcing White to take a decision with the Knight on b5}

17.Nc3 {The Knight goes back }

17...Nxe3 {Black eliminates the Bishop and hope to have a Bishop vs Knight imbalance}

18.Qxe3 {The correct recapture as 18.fxe3 saddles White with doubled e-file pawns}

18...Rad8 {The Rook is now on the open d-file}

19.Ne4 {White prepares Nc5 and wants to exchange the last pair of minor pieces also.19.Qe4 was perhaps slightly better as the pawn on b7 would have come under fire} 

19...Ba5 {The Bishop will come to b6 and exert its influence} 

20.Nc5 {Attacking the Queen and the pawn on b7}

20...Qd5 {A quiet move that defends the pawn on b7. 20...Qb5 was also okay for Black }

21.Qe2 {The White Queen does not want the nagging pin ...Bb6 to be unleashed and occupies a safe square leaving the a2 pawn for grabs}

21...Bd2 {Attacking the defender of the Knight on c5, Black invites White to play 22.Rfd1 and create complications}

22.Rc4 {22.Rfd1 creates complications. 22...Bxc1 23.Rxd5 Rxd5 24.b4 Ba3 and Black has good play} 

22...Bg5 {The Bishop retreats}

23.Nb3 {The Knight goes back to ease the tension and White threatens 24.Rxc7}

23...Qb5 {Pinning the Rook and halting White's Rxc7 idea}

24.Qe4 {The Queen gets out of the pin}

24...f5 {Attacking the White Queen again}

25.Qe2 {25.exf6 Bxf6 looks okay for both sides}

25...Be7 {Improving the position of the Bishop}
26.Re1 {Defending the Queen and threatening Rxc7}
26...c5  {The pawn advances and gains space on the Queenside}
27.Qc2 b6 {The White Queen was attacking the pawn on c5 indirectly and this move shuts down White's assault on the c-pawn}
28.Rc3 {White's pieces are tied down and this move will see the likely transfer of the Rook on the Kingside}
28...Qa4 {Attacking the pawn on a2 }
29.Qe2 g6 {Both sides just improve their positions}
30.h4 {Baiting the pawn for the Black Bishop on e7.30...Bxh4? 31.Rc4 winning the Bishop}
30...Qb5 {Offering to trade Queens and also making it possible to go for ...Bxh4 on the next move}
31.Qc2 {Exchanging Queens on the b5 square is not a good idea for White as Black will then have a dominating pawn mass on the Queenside}
31...Bxh4 {Grabbing the pawn on h4}
32.a4 {Good move as White wants to push a5 and break Black's pawn chain}
32...Qb4* {It is important to keep hold on the c4 square. 
White cannot play 33.Rc4?? Qxe1 wins for Black.Any other square for the Queen allows 
White to play a5.Now 33.a5? will be a mistake on account of 33...c4! and after the Knight moves. 34...b5 allows Black to gobble up 
the pawn on a5 later}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...e6 {Horowitz defense. Black wants to avoid the Trompowsky attack after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 attacking the Knight and the game drifts to newer challenges}

2.e4 {White is happy to transpose the game to the French defence}

2...d5 {The thematic response for Black challenging White's central control}

3.Nc3 {Kasparov considers this to be the correct response. This is the classical variation. 3.e5 is the advanced variation and 3.Nd2 is the Tarassch variation.
This move protects the attacked e4 pawn}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation which pins the Knight and again ...dxe4 is threatened on the next move}

4.e5 {White captures space in the centre and fixes the pawn structure. This is the main idea in the French defence where Black provokes White to fix his pawns on the d4 and e5 squares. Later on this 
pawn change will come under pressure.}

4...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain and gaining space on the Queenside}

5.a3 {White puts the question to the Bishop and hopes to win it gaining more control over the dark squares}

5...Bxc3+ {No retreating back in the Winawer}

6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch / Hook variation as it is known. The Queen attacks the c3 pawn}

7.Bd2 Qa4 {This Queen move is the speciality of this variation where the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn.Also the d4 pawn is attacked.White's main counter plan is to attack the g7 pawn by playing Qg4. The Black Queen's ...Qa4 move is 
played with an intention to negate White's Qg4 idea.}

8.h4!? {White opts for a provocative set-up and keeps the option of playing Rh3 later.
White gains space on the Kingside as this is the area he is stronger thanks to the pawn on e5.
8.Qg4 was perhaps the more aggressive response where White threatens Qxg7 and damage Black's pawn structure
8.Qb1 is also another sedate option threatening 9.Bb5+ winning the Black Queen. 8...c4 is played as a usual response to stop 9.Bb5+}

8...Nc6 {Another attack on the d4 pawn by developing a piece.}

9.h5  {White expands further and is keen to push h6.9 Qg4 was more prudent in my opinion}

9...h6 {Black halts the pawn march}

10.Qg4 {At last, the Queen joins the party and also protects the d4 pawn for the second time. The bigger threat is Qxg7 winning the Rook on h8 on the next move}

10...Kf8 {The Black King is the defender of the dark squares! 
Now Black has three threats a) ...Nxe5 taking advantage of the pinned d4 pawn. b) ...Qxc2 and c)...cxd4
10...Rh7 is also a playable move but then the success of the odd position of the Rook is based on 
a tactical shot if White were to make a mistake.
11.Bd3?! attacking the Rook on h7. 11...Nxe5! attacking the Queen and winning a pawn.
12.Qf4 Nxd3+ 123.cxd3 b6 and Black's Rook on h7 looks stupid although Black is a pawn up in this case.}

11.Qd1 {The Queen wisely returns back to defend the c2 pawn and White's aggression fizzles out. 
11.Qf4 threatening dxc5 allows Black to play 11...Qxc2 12.dxc5 Nge7 with uncertain play }

11...b6 {An insidious move that prepares ...Ba6 to exchange Black's perennial problem piece with White's good Bishop on f1.
This move also protects the pawn on c5 that was under attack.
11...cxd4 does look playable but 12.Nf3! Nge7 13.Nxd4 Nge7 14.Rh4! and White gets the pawn back with cxd4 on the next move. 
This would mean that White doubled c-pawns vanish off the board and the Bishop pair 
would give White a healthy advantage although Black can defend with accurate play.}

12.Nf3 {Simple development as White needs to get his act together}

12...Ba6 {Black wants to neutralise White's Bishop on f1}

13.Bxa6 {13.Rh4!? was an interesting choice threatening dxc5}

13...Qxa6 {The Queen prevents White from O-O now}

14.Qe2 {Offering a trade of Queens as well.}

14...Qxe2 {Black opts to go into an endgame. 14...Qa4 looks unsatisfactory. 15.dxc5 bxc5 16.c4! Ne7 17.cxd5 With this move White has managed to clear his weaknesses
on the Queenside and get a comfortable game.}

15.Kxe2 {Force recapture}

15...cxd4 {After a great deal of contemplation Black decides to open up the c-file. 15...c4 looks great at the outset but with minimal firepower 
at his disposal, Black can face the heat instead. White has easy play with moves like Rag1, Nh4,f4 and f5 to follow. }

16.cxd4 {Another forced recapture. 16.Nxd4? Nxe5! is good for Black}

16...Nge7 {Black brings his Knight out}

17.a4 {White wants to use Black's b6 pawn as a hook and intends to push a5 followed by axb6 to open up files}

17...f6 {Taking countermeasures in the  centre by attacking White's advanced pawn on e5}

18.a5 {White wants to get rid of the pawn and open up the a-file  to activate his Rooks}

18...bxa5 {18...Nxa5 helps White to open up the a-file after 19.Bxa5 bxa5 20.Rxa5 and White's Rooks will dominate the a and b-files}

19.Rhb1 {White is in no hurry to grab the pawn back on a5 and instead improves the Rook's position }

19...Kf7 {Connecting the Rooks as White plans to play Rb7 at some point and infiltrate Black's position
19...fxe5 looks attractive but then 20.Nxe5 Nxd4+ 21.Kd1 and the White Knight owns the g6 and f7 squares 
hampering Black's Rooks as the King cannot go down the board easily}

20.Bxa5 {White recaptures the pawn}

20...Nxa5 21.Rxa5 {Moving closer to a draw}

21...Rhc8 {Attacking the pawn on c2}

22.Kd3 {King supports the pawn}
22...Rc7 {Not allowing Rb7}
23.Ra6 {Creates a blockade on the a7 pawn. White wants to double the Rooks on the a-file and eventually collect the pawn on a7}
23...Rac8 {Attacking the pawn on c2 again with the Rook battery}
24.Rb2 {The pawn on c2 is protected}
24...Rc3+ 25.Kd2 {The onl;y move protecting the pawn on c2 as well}
25...R8c7 {The seventh rank is guarded}
26.Rba2 {The pawn on a7 is pressurised further}
26...R3c4 {Keeping the pressure on the d4 pawn}
27.g3 {White waits}
27...Nc8 {The Knight will go to b6 as the action is on the Queenside}
28.R6a3 {Covering the c3 square}
28...R4c6* {Black maintains his pressure on c2 square}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence}

2.d4 d5 {The standard position where White occupies both the central squares while Black has managed to attack the e4 pawn}

3.exd5 exd5 {The exchange variation}

4.h3?! {White wastes a whole move preventing Black from occupying the g4 square}

4...Nf6 {Black keeps developing}

5.Bd3 {This should have come a move earlier}

5...c5 {Gaining more space in the centre.}

6.Nf3 {Development and protecting the pawn on d4}

6...c4 {Black gains space on the Queenside and closes the centre. The Bishop on d3 is attacked}

7.Be2 Be6 {White White's Bishop retreats to safety, Black puts the light-squared Bishop on the f7-a2 diagonal.7...Bf5 would have allowed White to gain a tempo with g4 although it does not look good 
at the outset}

8.Bf4 {Another piece developed as White wants to play a possible Nb1-c3-b5 and attack the c7 square. This journey is too slow as Black can counter such ideas easily}

8...Bd6 {Challenging the "good" Bishop of White}

9.Bxd6 Qxd6 {The strong Bishop for White is now off the board}

10.c3 {White opts to solidify the d4 pawn further denying the Knight the c3 square}

10...O-O {Black completes Kingside development}

11.O-O {White too castles and safeguards his King}

11..Nc6 {Black brings out yet another piece and remains ahead in development}

12.Re1 {Improving the Rook's position}

12...b5 {Cementing the pawn on c4 further and Black has expanded well on the Queenside}

13.Nbd2 {The White Knight develops on a passive square}

13...Rab8 {Preparing ...b4. An immediate ...b4 was also possible followed by ...a5}

14.Ne5 {Occupying the central square and vacating the f3 square for the other Knight. Good move}

14...b4 {Black goes ahead wit his plan of expanding on the Queenside}

15.Bf3 {Threatening  Nxc4 on the next move and after ...dxc4 White would win back the Knight with Nxc6}

15...Ne7 {Getting out of the problem square c6.Now White is left with the problematic Knight on d2 which needs to find a secure place for some action}

16.Qc1 {Adding more protection to the pawn on c3.The Queen in all probability come to f4 after White plays Nf1 next} 

16...a5 {Black's mantra is to keep expanding on the Queenside.}

17.Bd1 {Preventing Black from a4. Also the Bishop will be better placed at a4}

17...Rb7 {Black wants to double the Rooks on the b-file. 18...Nd7 Attacking the influential Knight on e5 was also a good option}

18.Bc2 {Waiting move}

18...Rfb8 {More pressure on the b-file now}

19.Ndf3 {Reinforcing another Knight over the e5 square and White is playing to have a stake in the centre.Also Ng5 followed by Nxe6 is an idea}

19...h6 {Halting White's Ng5 move}

20.a3 {White questions Black's advanced b-pawn and forces him to take a decision}

20...b3 {20...bxa3 21.Rxa3 21...Rxb2 22.Rxa5 allows White sufficient activity along the a-file and the b-file later. 20...bxc3 21.bxc3 Rb2 22.a4 and again Black does not have anything good
as White will play Rb1 at some point and exchange Rooks}

21.Bb1 {The Bishop does not retreat to d1 as this allows 21..Bf5 and Black occupies even more light squares}

21...Re8 {The b-file is closed and the Rook retreats to the central e-file forfurther action}

22.Nh4 {White wants to push f4 at some point and start a Kingside expansion as the Queenside and the centre is closed.Also Nf5 is an idea after 
White pushes g4}

22...Qd8 {The Queen drops back and waits for White to take a call.}

23.Nhf3 {Another strange move. White gives away the pressure on the f5 square. 23.g4 was a much better idea cementing his grip over the f5 square. Then
White could have played Qf4 followed by Nf5 offering to trade pieces and ease the cramp in his position}

23...Nd7 {Offering to exchange a pair of Knights}

24.Qf4 {The Queen becomes active now and offers more protection to the Knight.White plans to push g4 now gaining space on the Kingside}

24...Nf8 {Protecting the Bishop on e6 as Black prepares to push ...f6 to kick the Knight away and foil White's Kingside expansion plans}

25.Nh4 {White does not mind the fork after 25...g5 as the pawn can be pinned with 26.Qg3}

25...Nd7 {Again the exchange of Knights is offered}

26.Nhf3 {The Knight dance continues!}
26...Nxe5 {Enough is enough says Black and trades!}

28.Qd2 {A move taking White backwards.}
28...Bc8 {...Re6 is coming soon}
29.Rf1 {White again plays a weird move.29.f4 or 29.Re3 would have been better options as White needs to gain an initiative on the Kingside}

30.Ng6 Kf7 {Attacking the Knight again}
31.Nf4 f5 {Black prepares ..g5 as the White Bishop's vigil is blocked}

[Annotator "Ganesh R Hegde"]

1.c4  {The English opening. White makes a deceptive start controlling the d5 square. The Knight can come to c3 later without the c2 pawn being blocked.
This opening can transpose to a variety of openings later depending on the move order}

1...c5 {The Symmetrical variation}

2.Nf3 {Considered the best continuatuon for White }

2...g6 {Black is keen to fianchetto his dark-squared Bishop that will control the d4 square and limit White's options}

3.e4 {The game transposes to the Hungarian variation of the Sicilian defence which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.c4. 
The game is no more an English!}

3...Nc6 {As White cannot play Bb5 as in the Sicilian Rossolimo, the Knight can come out on c6 and control the e5 square}

4.d4 {Looks to be a forced choice as Black will play ...Bg7 later and get a great grip on the d4 square}

4...cxd4 {Excahinging the central pawn for a flank pawn and opening up the c-file for activity later}

5.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}

5...Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn}

6.Nc3 d6 {Now we are into the Sicilian Maroczy Bind}

7.Be2 {A quiet move but solid. White's idea is to create a complex of light-squared pawns on f3,b3. The Bishop assists in the defence of the light squares. The bind on the d5 square will later 
be exploited by a possible Nd5.Also this move enables White to control the g4 square and prepares Be3}

7...Nxd4 {Trading pieces when you have less space and forcing White's Queen to come on d4. White Queen will have to waste a tempo after 
Black plays ...Bg7 threatening a discovered attack on the Queen}

8.Qxd4 Bg7 {Black follows up with his plan on move 7 and prepares O-O}

9.Be3 {White Queen will most probably come back to d2 and create a Bishop-Queen battery to play Bh6 later}

9...O-O {Black threatens ...Ng4}

10.Qd2 {The best move according to theory and practice where White has to waste a tempo to prevent ...Ng4}

10...Be6 {Black is the first to complete development and now the Bishop on e6 attacks the pawn on c4.The d7 square is kept vacant for the Knight to 
come to the Queenside}

11.O-O {White completes his development with a slight space advantage}

11...Qa5 {The idea is to play on the Queenside with moves like ...Rfc8,...a6 and ...b5 where the Queen assists the pawn advance.The move also deters White from moving his Knight to d5 as Black would then exchange Queens}

12.Rfc1 {12.Rab1 was perhaps better where White can push b4 later and drive away the Black Queen}

12...Nxe4 {It is time for some tactics! The next five to seven are almost forced as Black gets into a forced endgame where White's positional might is 
reduced considerably.}

13.Nxe4 {Forced.Any other move means the Knight will retreat back and Black won a pawn for nothing}

13...Qxd2 {Foced or else Black would be down a Knight for nothing}

14.Nxd2 {14.Bxd2 is also not effective either as Black would have the same response}

14...Bxb2 {Forking the Rooks. Now Black has two pawns for the Knight and soon White will have two pieces against the Black Rook and a pawn}

15.Bf3 {The most effective continuation as the b7 pawn is attacked. In the ensuing moves Black will lose both the pawns on a7 and b7 but will get the a2 pawn}

15...Rab8 {Protecting the b7 pawn. 15...Bxc1 16.Rxc1 Rab8 is also acceptable}

16.Bxa7 {More or less forced to maintain a slight egde. If manages to push ...b6 then Black will gain an advantage}

16...Bxc1 {16...Bxa1? is bad 17.Rxa1 Ra8 18.Be3 and the pawn on a2 cannot be captured. Hence the capturing on c1 to move away the Rook to the c1 square }

17.Rxc1 Ra8 {Attacking the Bishop and clearing the path to the a2 square}

18.Be3 {The Bishop goes back  to defend the d2 Knight as the Black Rooks will dominate the second rank soon}

18...Rxa2 {Another forced move to gain back lost material}

19.Bxb7 {Another move to grab a pawn back}

19...Rb8 {The comb9ination from move 12 now ends with White having a Bishop pair against a Rook and a pawn}

20.Bf3 {20.Be4 was slightly better as the f3 square could have been used by the Knight on d2}

20...Rbb2 {Black Rooks dominate the second rank and threaten to capture two pieces for a Rook}

21.Rd1 {21.Nf3 was possible only if 20.Be4 would have been chosen}

21...Bf5 {With the idea of ...Bc2 and restricting White's movements further}

22.c5 {Trying to create a passed pawn after c6. Also White wants to activate his Knight to e4 if Black plays ...dxc5}

22...Bc2 {Attacking the Rook. Black aims to tie down White's pieces}

23.Re1 dxc5 {Grabbing the pawn on offer}

24.Bxc5 {White grabs the pawn back.}

24...Bd3 {Attacking the Knight again and cutting off the c4 square for the Knight. It looks like 24...e6 solves Black's problems but actually White's Bishop pair will now become dangerous. 
24...Bd3 {Attacking the Knight again and cutting off the c4 square for the Knight. It looks like 24...e6 solves Black's problems but actually White's Bishop pair will now become dangerous. 
25.Bd4! Rb5 26.Bc6 and White's Bishops will keep harassing the Rooks until they find favourable squares. Black's dark square weaknesses around the 
King will become pronounced.}

25.Nf1 {The Knight goes back and White renews the pressure on the e7 pawn}

25...e5 {The pawn cannot be captured as 26.Rxe5? leads to 26...Rb1 and the Knight on f1 comes under fire}

26.g4 {Making room for the Bishop on g2}

26...Be2 {The pawn on g4 will be left hanging if White plays 27.Bg2 Black forces an exchange of Bishops}

27.Bxe2 Rxe2 {Black trades into a drawish ending}

28.Rb1 {White Rook is the only piece now that can generate some counterplay}

28...f5 {The pawn on g4 is asked a questtion - Would you go g5 or exchange?}

29.Rb8+ {White puts in an in-between move and activates the Rook}

29...Kf7 {29..Kg7 is also okay for Black}

30.Rb7+ {Another check to force the Black King to the e6 square. }

30...Kg8 {30...Ke6 looks like a mistake. 31.Ne3 cutting off the d5 square for the Black King and now White threatens Re7+.
Also Rxh7 will allow White to win a free pawn. The move played keeps everything tight as the h7 pawn is also protected}

31.gxf5 {31.h3 is weak on account of 31...f4 and White's Knight on f1 will have a hard time making any impact as the e3 and g3 squares are taken away}

31...gxf5 {Black looks comfortable}

32.Ng3 {Attacking the Rook on e2}

32...Rec2 {Attacking the Bishop now as White cannot take 33.Nxf5}

33.Rc7 {White lays a subtle trap for Black tempting him to push ...f4}

33...Ra5 {Attacking the Bishop again and forcing White to exchange Rooks}

34.Bb6 {Protecting the Rook on c7 and paving the way for further simplification}

34...Rxc7 {Black's story so far...exchange,exchange and exchange!}

35.Bxc7 {The Black Rook on a5 is still under the hammer}

35...Rc5 {Attacking the Bishop now as the game heads towards a draw}

36.Bd6 {The Rook is attacked again}

36...Rd5 {The Rook keeps the Bishop busy as draw looms}

37.Nxf5 {The Bishop is supported}

37...Kf7 {The King comes out and improves its position}

38.Bb4 {White Bishop shies away}

38...Rd1+ {Now the Rook will try to keep checking the King and stymie White's advance}

39.Kg2 Kg6 {Attacking the Knight}

40.Ne3 {Attacking the Black Rook}
40...Rd3 {The Rook keeps control of the d-file}
41.Be7 {The Bishop might want to go to h4 and support the King and the Knight for the passage of pawns to victory}
41...Rd4 {Keeping control over the h4 square with an offer of a draw to White. White accepts the peace offer}1/2-1/2
