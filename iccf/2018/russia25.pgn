1.Nf3 {The Zukertort opening is a flank opening that is extremely flexible and allows White to remain non-commital
about his pawn structure.After 1...c5 2.e4 this opening transposes to the Sicilian Defense.}
1...Nf6 {Black copies White and throws the option back to White for commiting the pawn structure}
2.c4 {White thrusts the flank c-pawn to control the d5 square}
2...Na6!? {An interesting move perhaps trying to surprise White}
3.Nc3 {White takes out the other knight and is now controlling all the four central squares.White can now aim to play e4 on the next move}
3...d6 {An okay move that plans to push ...e5 or ...c5 for claiming a stake in the centre.}
4.d4 {White grabs the opportunity to grab the centre with a central pawn}
4...g6 {Black decides to fianchetto the King's Bishop on g7 and play a hypermodern way of controlling the central squares with his pieces}*
5.e4 {White decides to dominate the centre and grab more space with this move}
5...Bg7 {Black continues with his development.Perhaps a better move would have been 5...Bg4 as this piece would find
it difficult to develop}
6.h3 {A prophylactic move to prevent theQueen's Bishop from occupying the g4 square}
6...O-O {Black develops further on the kingside and brings out the rook}
7.Be2 {White too develops quietly. Perhaps 7.Bd3 was slightly better as the bad Bishop could have supported the e4 pawn}
7...e5 {Black had to do something to have his own stake in the centre.A good move.7...c5 is also another candidate move but slightly inferior as the c5 square
would be deprived for the knight on a6}
8.d5 {White grabs more space and keeps the centre locked. 7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Nxe5? Qxd1+! 9.Bxd1 Nxe4! 10.Nxe4 Bxe5 and Black has managed to rip apart the centre
With this tricky move order,Black has finally achieved to get into a variation of the King's Indian defense}
8...Qe8?! {Black plays another move that is difficult to understand.8...Nc5 followed by ...a5 looks more promising for Black.
Black is looking at a possible Qe8-Bd7 formation followed by ...Nc5 and ...a5 ...a4. This move also acts as an insurance if White were to play
Bg5. In this case the knight on f6 is not pinned and is free to move as per the situation.}
9.Nd2!? {Nice move.This move has a lot of venom for Black. The Knight on f6 is planning to jump to h5 followed by ...f5 attacking the light-squared pawn chain complex on e4.This move
prevents ...Nh5 as both the White Queen and King's Bishop are now eyeing the h5 square.Also Black cannot play ...Nc5 on the next move and attack the pawn on e4 because 10.b4! kicks the knight back to a6 and White gains space on the
Queenside}
9...Bd7 {Black is now planning ...c6,...Nc7,...a5 followed by ...a4 to gain a Queenside expansion.}
10.Nb3!? {Prevents ...Nc5 for Black.Now Black will have to play ...c6 followed by ...Nc7 to bring back the Knight to the middle of the board}
10...c5 {Black locks the centre and controls the d4 square.Infact,Black has adopted a dark-square strategy which he will look to dominate}
11.O-O {Develop the Rook and keeping the safe is a priority}
11...b6 {Weird looking move that puts another pawn on a dark square.Black is not revealing any clear-cut ideas.A better idea was
to play on the Queenside with ...Nc7,...Rab8,...a6 and then ...b5 later to push for a Queenside initiative.The Knight on ...a6 needs to find a better square}
12.Re1 {White too refrains from commiting his pawn structure.White can also look forward to obtain a Queenside initiative.}
12...Qe7 {Another baffling move. Black is reluctant to carry out his Queenside pawn push. 12...Nc7 was more precise}
13.Bg5{White develops the Bishop and pins the Knight.Black will have waste tempi to unpin the Knight}
13...h6{Black puts the question to the Bishop : capture the Knight or retreat}
14.Bh4 {The Bishop retreats with the pin intact}
14...Nc7 {The Knight is now back into action after a series of weird moves}
15.Nd2 {White's Knight will go back to another square and vacates the b-file for the pawn push b3 or b4. White is not expanding
on the Queenside by rushing with pawn pushes. This remaneouvring of the Knight is a waiting move as White should not commit the pawn structure hastily}
15...a6 {Black now prepares to expand on the Queenside. Moves like ...Rfb8 and ...b5 are on the cards}
16.a4 {Preventing ...b5 for the moment.This cannot be stopped though}
16...Rfb8 {Black continues with his plan to push ...b5.Black's position is cramped but there are no positional weaknesses}
17.Qc2 {The Queen move connects the Rooks and prepares the move Reb1 so that both the Rooks can participate in the battle for
Queenside advantage}
17...Qf8 {17...Qe8 is logical and consistent with Black's plan of pushing b5.Black plays another strange move}
18.a5!? {White invites Black to open up the game with ...bxa5 or keep the b-file closed with ...b5. An immediate 18.Reb1 can allow Black to
play 18...a5!? and create an outpost on b4. Black's closing of the Queenside means White's chances of winning diminish}
18...Nh7 {Black is looking to expand on the Kingside with moves like ...f5,...g5}
19.Reb1 {The idea is to push b4 and open up the Queenside.}
19...Bf6 {Black wants to trade the dark-squared Bishop. Not a good idea as White's Bishop on h4 was doing nothing.Black is making life difficult for himself
Instead 19...f5 20.f3 Bf6 made much sense as now Black also has the option of pushing ...f4 after the trade of the Bishops}
20.Bxf6 {White gets rid of the Bishop that was not doing anything concrete}
20...Nxf6 {Recapture}
21.axb6 {White opens up the a-file for further activity.}
21...Rxb6 {Black too gets the semi-open b-file for counterplay.}
22.b3 {If Black decides to double the Rooks on the b-file then the pawn on b2 requires baby-sitting.This move solidfies White's
light-square pawn complex and the pawn on b3 now is quarded by the Knight.The Rook on b1 and the White Queen are now free to go elsewhere}
22...h5 {Black expands on the Kingside}
23.Na4 {The chess engine terms this as a bad move.But in this closed position, White's move comes with the following ideas : (a) If 23...Bxa4 then
White wins the good Bishop and the position is okay for both sides but if Black chooses option (b) and retracts the Rook then the Knight can go to d3 via b2.From d3 the Knight can keep a vigil on the c5 and e5 pawns. White
can then open up the position with a timely f4 pawn break.}
23...Bxa4 {Black opts for option (a) above}
24.Rxa4 {White now has to be vigilant about Black's Kingside expansion.}
24...h4 {Black expands further but I feel that the pawn is overstretched.Black's Rooks are still on the Queenside and Black's Kingside push is raw and hasty}
25.Re1 {White will remove the Bishop from e2 and support the pawn on e4 with the help of the Rook.With a nice Rook-lift to e3 the Rook can also guard the pawn on b3
White's Queen and the Knight can then move freely and create pressure in the closed position}
25...Rab8 {Black doubles the Rooks on the semi-open b-file and intends to push ...Rb4}
26.Bd1{The Bishop will go to c2 to take care of the b3 and e4 pawns simultaneously while the Queen will come back to do better things}
26...Qh6 {With an intention of playing ...Qf4}
27.Qc3 {Vacating the c2 square for the light-squared Bishop.The Queen will then be free to go to the Kingside for a possible showdown with her counterpart}
27...Kg7 {Good waiting move}
28.Re3 {The Rook also supports the pawn on b3.White's idea is to bring the Bishop on c2 followed by bringing the other rook to f1 vvia a4-a1-f1 and then push g3-f4 to open up the Kingside}
28...Nce8 {The Knight will go to the Kingside}
29.Nf3 {Preventing Nh5 but the pawn on e4 is now devoid of a defender }
29...Qf4 {Attacking the e4 pawn twice}
30.Bc2 {The Bishop is an excellent defender. Clears the first rank for a possible retreat of the Rook and Queen}
30...Nh5 {Black has made a great comeback after the questionable opening play}
31.Re1 {Intending to play Qe3 or Qa1-Qc3 to trade Queens depending upon Black's response}
31...Nef6 {Consolidating further but the Queen on f4 is stuck}
32.Qe3{Offering to exchange Queens}
32...Rh8 {Protecting the h4 pawn indirectly because after 33.Qxf4 Nxf4 34.Nxh4 is now not possible due to the Rook on h8}
33.Qxf4 Nxf4 {The Queens go off the board and Black for the first time in the game stands equal}
34.Kh2 {34.Rea1 and the pawn on a6 can be taken on the next move but this move has a subtle variation that allows Black long term equality and better drawing chances.
34.Rea1 Ne2+! 35.Kf1 Nd4 36.Nxd4 exd4 is okay for Black}
34...Kf8?! {Awkward move again.Black had made a strong comeback in the middlegame.34...Ne8 intending ...Nc7 was a good choice.
Another good move was ...Rh5 intending to push ...g5 ...g4 with a nice counter-attack on the Kingside.}
35.Rea1 {White adds more pressure on the a6 pawn and can grab it on the next move}
35...g5!? {Nice move.Black keeps up the pressure on the Kingside and is not bothered about the pawn loss on a6}
36.Rxa6{White captures the pawn}
36...Rxa6 {The Rook has done its job} 37.Rxa6 {A pair of Rooks go off the board with Black having counterplay on the Kingside}
37...Rh6 {38.Rxd6?? Ng4+ and Black wins the Rook on the next move}
38.Ra8+ {An in-between check before White tries to break the deadlock}
38...Kg7 {Safe King}
39.Nd2 {White wants to re-position the Knight on f1 to control the g3 square.Black's pawn push ...g4 looks inevitable}
39...g4 {Black follows his Kingside advance}
40.Nf1 {The Knight will re-direct to e3 }
40...Ne2 {Draw agreed as White will find it difficult to make any positive impact}1/2-1/2

1...Nf6 {Black's symmetrical response sets the tone for a flexible set-up}
2.c4 {White controls the d5 square with the flank pawn}

8.e3 {Necessary to prevent d4 or else the Queen's Bishop on b2 would look foolish}
8...d4 {Black plays the reversed Modern Benoni}
9.exd4 cxd4 {Essential capture by White to keep a slight edge.Black responds by keeping the pawn wedge on d4.
Black will aim to play ...e5 and throttle White's dark-squared Bishop on b2}
10.Re1!? {Necessary to prevent Black from pushing ...e5}
10...Ne8 {Black intends to play ...f6 followed by ...e5.Perhaps slightly better was 10...Re8 that threatens ...e5 on the next move.The Rook would have controlled the e-file and aided support to the pawn on ...e5 after Black achieves that goal}
11.Ne5 {White needs to remove himself from the cramp and exchange pieces}

1...d5 {Black plays the "natural" opening move and controls the centre with the Queen pawn}
2.c4 {White stakes claim to the d5 square himself and offers Black the option of exchanging the central pawn with a
flank pawn. This is not a gambit as White can play 3.Qa4+ followed by 4.Qxc4+ if Black responds with 2...dxc4}

bishop thought. But Black can play ...b6 and then play ...Bb7 to control the important d5 and e4 squares via the long diagonal}

19...Rfd8 {Simple chess from Black.Position is too easy}
20.Rxc8 {White liquidates further.The position is looking drawish at the moment.}

2...d5 {White was threatening to play e2-e4 on the next move and Black prevents the same}
3.Bg5 {The Richter-Veresov attack that threatens to disrupt Black's kingside pawns and then play e4}
3...c5!? {Black does not care about White's threat and instead employs his own aggression by challenging White's central pawn}
4.Bxf6 {White goes ahead with his plan}
4...gxf6 {4...exf6 is considered a mild recapture.The move played opens up the g-file for the Black rook.
Black can play ...Rg8 and ...Bg7 at some point to play attacking chess}
5.e3 {A timid move.White should have continued with 5.e4}
5...Nc6 {Development and reinforcing the control over the d4 square.Simple chess}
6.a3?! {A waste of a move in my opinion.White showed his attacking instincts on the third move and suddenly has decided to play placid chess.
6.Qh5 threatening Nxd5 on the next move followed by O-O-O would have been far more consistent. The move played in the game is bereft of ideas}
6...cxd4 {Black captures one of the central White pawns and opens up the c-file for his rook later.White is now forced to recapture with the e-pawn and Black then has ideas like
...e5,...Bg7,...Rg7,...f5 that not only control the centre but also activate the pieces}
7.exd4{Nothing better}
7...Rg8!? {Black brings the Rook on the semi-open g-file.Black intends to undermine White's Kingside development and will castle long as the played move suggests}
8.g3 {Can Black exploit this pawn weakness on the Kingside?}
8...e5 {8...Bg4 was another good choice for Black. Developing the Queen's Bishop and taking a small step towards castling Queenside was also playable}
9.Nge2 {Controlling the d4 square and also preventing the pin from the Queen's Bishop after ...Bg4}
9...Bh6!? {Another interesting move from Black.The dark-squared Bishop does not allow White to play Qd2 followed by castling}
10.dxe5 {Better choice from White. Here White opens the d-file and will try to neutralise by exchanging pieces. The first attack is on the d5 pawn}
10...d4 {Gaining space in the centre}
11.Ne4 {The Knight is ready to jump to the c5 square}
11...fxe5 {Black recaptures the pawn and reinforces more control on the d4 square}
12.Bg2 {White has to start developing pieces and this is a move in that direction}
12...Rg6 {Improving the Rook's position.This move looks odd but the Rook can go the d6 square and aid in pushing the central pawn duo.
Black intends to play ...f5 on the next move and kick the Knight away}
13.O-O  {Development of the Kingside is complete}
13...f5 {Grabbing more space and attacking the Knight}
14.Nc5 {The only good option available. 14.Nd2 looks too passive}
14...Rd6 {Black intends to steam roll the central pawn duo down the board}
15.f4{Attacking the e5 pawn.White has castled the King and can afford to make a move that apparently weakens the Kingside pawn complex}
15...Qc7{The Queen will attack the Knight on c5 once the Rook moves to h6.Black also intends to push ...e4 and ...b6 to gain more space}
16.b4 {White protects the Knight in advance and also starts the Queenside expansion of pawns}
16...b6{Kicking the Knight back}
17.fxe5{White attacks the Rook instead while grabbing a central pawn}
17...Be3+ {The Bishop goes into the heart of White's position}
18.Kh1 {Forced}
18...Rh6 {Protecting the Rook}
19.Nd3 {The Knight moves back to safety and also protects the e5 pawn.}
19...Bb7 {Black leaves the f5 pawn hanging but intends to capture ...Nxe5 on the next move. Also O-O-O is on the cards}
20.Nef4 {White does not accept the f5 pawn bait. 20.Rxf5?! Ne7 with the threat of ...Bxg2+ followed by ...Qb7 is crushing.21.Rf3 Bxf3 22.Bxf3 Rd8 is good for Black}
20...O-O-O {Activating the Rook on a8.The King is also safe}
21.Qf3 {Connecting the rooks}
21...Kb8 {King position is improved}
22.Nd5 {Attacking the Queen}
22...Nxe5 {Black instead wants to get White's Queen in return}
23.Nxc7 Nxf3 {The Queens are off the board and Black's initiative deflates}
24.Bxf3 Kxc7 25.Bxb7 Kxb7 26.Rxf5 {The pieces go off the board in a jiffy}
26...Rc8 {After the heavy simplification,Black is now looking to infiltrate the seventh rank }
27.Rf7+ {White penetrates the seventh rank and checks the King}
27...Rc7 {Further simplification offered as the game moves closer to a draw}
28.Rxc7 Kxc7 {Close to a draw. White has an extra pawn but Black's Bishop is healthy and gives Black drawing chances}
29.b5 {Expansion on the Queenside with a move like a4 on the cards soon}
29...Rf6 {The White Rook must not be allowed on the f-file}
30.Kg2 Kd6 {Bothg sides take the first step towards King activation}
31.Rf1 {Offering to exchange Rooks}
31...Rxf1 {Important to exchange Rooks and keep the White King at bay. White has an extra pawn and Black cannot allow
White's King from occupying the central squares.31...Bg5? allows 32.Rxf6 Bxf6 33.Kf3 and with moves like h4,g3,g4 on the cards White will probably win}
32.Kxf1 Kd5 {The King will sneak in via the c4 route and try to grab the pawns.Draw agreed}1/2-1/2

1.Nf3 {White begins with the flexible Zukertort opening that does not commit any particular pawn structure and waits for Black to take the call}
1...f5 {Black answers with the dynamic Dutch defence and controls the e4 square}
2.d4 {White pulls out the Queen pawn to the central d4 square and controls the c5 and e5 squares}
2...Nf6 {Develop a piece and plan to castle soon. The move played adds more control to the e4 square.}
3.g3 {White decides to control the e4 and d5 squares via the long diagonal. White can also play Nc3,c4,Qc2 with ideas of playing e4 - a key motif in this setup}
3...g6 {The Leningrad variation of the Dutch defence.Black will control the h8-a1 diagonal with the Bishop on g7.Black's idea is to push ...e5 later with the aid of this Bishop}
4.c4 {Good consistent chess adding more contol over the d5 square}
4...Bg7 {Black is also consistent with his ideas}
5.Bg2 {White is aiming for solid development}
5...d6 {The classical variation.Black cannot allow White to steam roll in the centre.This pawn move aims for ...e5 later}
6.b3 {White decides to fianchetto the other Bishop as well.6.Nc3 would have been more accurate as it goes with the idea of pushing for e4 later}
6...Ne4!? {An interesting idea.Black has made first use of the h8-a1 diagonal and does not intend to allow White to neutralise the effect
White cannot push d5 to gain central space as the White Rook on a1 is en-prise. WIthout worrying about the move d5,Black can now aim to play ...d5,...O-O and then aim to push ...e5 - a thematic idea in the Dutch defence}
7.Bb2 {The Queen's Bishop comes on the long diagonal and exerts indirect pressure on the e5 square}
7...e5!? {Black follows the plan immediately.Occupying the e5 square is an important motif for Black in this setup}
8.O-O {Completes the development of the kingside and brings out the rook.}
8...O-O {Black also castles and asks White to take a decision regarding the pawn capture on e5}
9.dxe5 {White releases the tension in the centre with a move recommended by Stockfish.
9.e3 would have kept the tension going and forced Black to take a call.9.Nfd2 was also another idea
asking Black's Knight to exchange and vacate the e4 square for the pawn push e2-e4 later.}
9...Nc6 {Black develops the Knight and threatens to win back the pawn on e5 immediately.The White pawn on e5 cannot move now as the dark-squared Bishop on b2 is hanging}
10.Nd4?! {White plays a move that defies logic.The Knight could have moved to d2 and forced Black's Knight on e4 to take a decision.
10.Nc3 was also an excellent choice forcing Black to play 10...Nxc3 11.Bxc3 with good chances}
10...Nxe5 {Black avoids the exchange of Knights and instead equalises by picking up the pawn}
11.Nc3 {The Knight develops finally and puts the question to his counterpart on e4.Either quit the e4 square by going back or exchange}
11...Nc5 {Black does not exchange the Knight but instead takes the game into unchartered territory}
12.b4 {The right move as White takes his opportunity to expand on the Queenside with a tempo on the Knight}
12...Na6 {The Knight moves to the rim and attacks the b4 pawn.the c4 pawn is also under attack from the other Knight.12...Ne6 leads to a complex position
13.Bxb7 Nxc4 14.Bxa8 Nxb2 15.Qb3 Bxd4 16.Qxb2 Qf6 and White is an exchange up but Black's Bishop pair are some compensation}
13.Nd5 {13.Qb3 would have solved both the pawn issues.The c4 and b4 pawns would have been protected.13...c6 14.Rad1 and it is an equal position}
13...Nxc4?! {Black grabs the pawn on offer and attacks the dark-squared Bishop.Risky chess begins.This move is actual not correct as Black ends up losing a pawn in another few moves as we see in this game}
14.Bc3 {The dark-squared Bishop goes to a safe square on the same diagonal neutralising Black's dark Bishop.}
14...c5 {Black attacks the centralised knight with the c-pawn and in the process vacates the c7 square for the Knight on a6}
15.Nb5 {The best move as the attacked Knight jumps to b5 and opens up the dark-squared diagonal. The Knight is eyeing the backward d6 pawn and White seems to have adequate compensation for the sacrificed pawn}
15...Bxc3 {Not 15...cxb4?? 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.Qd4+ and White wins the Knight on c4
15...Nxb4 looks a risk too many as 16.Bxg7 Kxg7 17.Nxb4 a6 18.Nc3 cxb4 19.Nd5 Ne5 and White looks better as Black's pawn structure is wretched and the King over-exposed}
16.Ndxc3 {The right capture as the d5 square is now vacated for the Bishop or the Queen to deliver a check and attack the Knight on c4 simultaneously}
16...Kh8 {The King gets out of the threatened square and the capture of the pawn of b4 is again renewed}
17.a3! {Excellent move. White saves the pawn and puts the question to Black.White's pieces have a lot of latent energy and are waiting for files to open.}
17...Rb8!? {An anti-engine move that prepares the Rook on the b-file.Black does not commit anything as far as the pawns are concerned.
17...Nc7 that looks like the best move does not give anything for Black. 18.Nxc7 Qxc7 19.Rc1! with an X-ray attack on the hanging Knight}
18.Qd5 {White attacks the hanging Knight on c4 }
18...Nb6 {Forced move which helps Black to get rid of the Queen}
19.Qxd6 Qxd6 {White gets back the pawn and Black is happy to see the Queens off the board}
20.Nxd6 cxb4 {Black exchanges pawns with an intention of removing all White's pawns on the Queenside.Black will end up losing all the pawns too on the Queenside.White
has an extra e-pawn but with similar pawn structures on the Kingside,Black can hold on for a draw}
21.axb4 Nxb4 {As per plan}
22.Rxa7 {Now the b7 pawn is under threat from three of White's pieces}
22...Be6 {Black neglects the defence of the b7 pawn as it is going to fall soon.It is good for Black to concentrate on the important
central squares like d5 at the moment.
22...Nc6 looks an attractive option but 23.Bxc6 bxc6 does not solve Black's problem as the pawn on b6 will always be a targt of White's attack
It is better for Black to play with more freedom at the cost of a pawn}
23.Rxb7 {White is a pawn up but has no good initiative}
23...N4d5 {Black attacks the Knight on c3 and brings the Knight on to a purposeful square}
24.Nxd5 {White liquidates further hoping to convert the extra pawn in the endgame}
24...Nxd5 {Black accepts the Knight but refuses to do anything with the Rook on b7. 24...Rxb7 25.Nxb7 was also okay}
25.Rfb1 {White doubles the Rooks on the b-file and maintains the tension}
25...Rxb7 {Black breaks the tension with a pair of Rooks going off the board}
26.Rxb7 {White occupies the seventh rank but there is nothing much to cheer}
26...Nf6 {Black is now looking forward to exchanging White's e-pawn if White pushes e4}
27.Bc6 {The Bishop comes out of the pawn formation and White intends to push f3 followed by e4 at the correct moment}
27...Kg8 {Black too does not commit anything}
28.f3{White prepares e4}
28...Rd8 {Attacking the Knight and preparing ...Rd2}
29.Nb5 {Safe and sound}
29...Rd2 {Attacking the e2 pawn}
30.Kf2 {Forced to protect}
30...Bc4 {More pressure on the e2 pawn}
31.Re7 {Forced move to protect the e2 pawn}
31...Kf8 {Attacking the defender of the e2 pawn}
32.Re3 {Protects the Rook from the King}
32...Bf7 {Black retracts the Bishop and waits}
33.Ra3 {White is trying his level best to squeeze the pawn advantage to a victory by not pushing the pawns and just waiting for Black to take an incorrect step}
33...Bc4 {With the same idea of ...Rxe2+}
34.Nc3 {Knight is brought back for the defence of the pawn on e2}
34...Rc2 {The Rook attacks the defender of the e2 pawn and White's Rook is now tangled to save the Knight}
35.Ba4 {The Bishop attacks the Rook}
35...Rb2 {The Black Rook is not going away soon from the second rank}
36.Bd1 {White now connects the pieces and also supports the pawn on e2}
36...Rb7 {Guarding the seventh rank and White will have to regroup all his troops}
37.h3 {White waits.Planning to push g4 and swap pawns. White's pawn on e2 holds the key.}
37...Rc7 {Black opens up an X-ray attack on the Knight on c3 which does not allow White's Rook from going to the a5 square because
38.Ra5 will be met with 38...Be6 and the White Knight needs support again}
38.Bc2 {A quiet move.The pawn push g4 is on the cards}
38...Ng8 {An intuitive move that prepares to meet the g4 move with ...Ne7}
39.Bb3 {White offers the trade of Bishops as 39.g4 Ne7 40.gxf5 Nxf5 leaves White with an isolated h-pawn and less chances of a win}
39...Bxb3 {Black is happy to exchange and inch closer to a draw}
40.Rxb3 Ne7 {The Knight jumps to e7 after the Bishops go off the board}
41.Nd1 {The Rook is now free to move.Also the Knight will now go to e3 and if required to g2 is assisting the pawn march}
41...Rc1 {Forcing the Knight to e3.}
42.Ne3 Rc5 {The Rook guards the fifth rank and waits for White to make a decision}
43.Rb4 {Preparing g4}
43...h5!? {Black risks his pawn structure to prevent White from pushing g4.Only time will tell whether Black will draw this game although it looks the most likely result}
44.Rd4 {White waits again for another change in Black's pawn structure.}
44...Kf7 {Now the King is finally out to make amends}
45.h4 {Fixing the pawn structure}
45...Kf6 {Improving the King's position}
46.Ng2{Improving the Knight's position}

51...Rb5 {Repeating the Rook move and White again has to decide}
52.Kf1 {White waits again for Black to get impatient}
52...Kg7 {Black too joins the waiting game}
53.Ng2 {Planning Nf4 with an attack on the g6 pawn}
53...Nd5 {Black prevents White from moving his Knight to f4}
54.Ke1 {The King wants to come out for some action}
54...Rb1+ {Pushing the King back.}
55.Kf2 {Forced. 55.Ke2? Rg1! attacking the Knight. Black will win the g3 pawn and draw easily}
55...Rb5 {The Rook is back to the best square available.Only White's Rook is not tied now}
56.Ne1 {Nd3 is the idea on the next move}
56...Nb4 {Blocking White's plan}
57.Rd7+ {Another wait and watch move}
57...Kf6 {Safe King}
58.Rd2 {White is trying something new to break Black's grip}
58...Ke6 {Centralising the King further}
59.Rd8 {Rb2 was the best option to break the stranglehold.}
59...Rb6 {Protecting the sixth rank and waiting further}
60.Rc8 {Cat and mouse game continues}
60...Kf7 {Black King is upto the task of frustrating White}
61.Rc4 {Another move that is only strtching the game}
61...Ke7 {Black has enough waiting moves at his disposal}
62.Rc5 {White has stealthily entered the fifth rank and wants to prevent Black from playing ...Nd5 so that White can pursue Ne1-Ng2-Nf4 idea}
62...Kd6 {Black solves the ...Nd5 problem by controlling the d5 square.The Rook is guarding the sixth rank and Black is solid here}
63.Ra5 Ke6 {Black's King controls the d5 square}
64.Ra3 {Hide-and-seek continues}
64...Kf6 {The sixth rank belongs to the King as the game continues}
65.Rb3 {White tries the PIN idea to get rid of Black's grip}
65...Nd5 {Preparing to exchange Rooks and get into a drawish endgame}
66.Ra3 {White refuses to trade Rooks}
66...Nb4 {The prophylactic continuation is on. The Knight on e1 is restricted}
67.Ra5 Ke6 {White was controlling the d5 square laterally.The Black King negates that influence and rekindles the option of playing ...Nd5 if required}
68.Rc5 {White keeps on trying to break open}
68...Kd6 {The Rook is kicked again}
69.Rc3 Ke5 {The Black King can jog around nicely!}
70.Rb3 {Pinning the Rook again}
70...Kf6 {70...Nd5 is hasty as 71.Nd3+ allows White's Knight an entry into the game}
71.Ng2 {The Knight wants to enter the game via f4}
71...Nd5 {Preventing Nf4 but also offering to trade Rooks}
72.Ra3 {White cannot afford to trade Rooks}
72...Kf7 {Black and White are simply repeating the sequence with no headway in sight}
73.Ne1 {Nd3 on the next move is the idea that reappears again}
73...Nb4 {The same moves have been played for sometime now}
74.Rb3 {Again the pin comes into play}
74...Kf6 {Not 74...Nd5?! as 75.Rxb6 Nxb6 76.Nd3 allows the Knight back into the game and White will probably win due to the extra pawn
76.Ke3 will also be possible in that case giving White an active position}
75.Ng2 Nd5 {Both horses are playing the cat-and-mouse game to perfection as the fight for the f4 square continues! }
76.Rxb6 Nxb6 {White trades Rooks and is looking at a fresh attempt to Queen the extra pawn}
77.Ke3 {Improving the King's position}
77...g5?? {Looking to challenge the pawns and draw the game soon but this is a blunder that alters the pawn structure.Better was ...Nc4+}
78.Kd4 {The e3 square is vacated and the King is ready for action}

1.d4 f5 {White's solid Queen's pawn opening is answered by the dynamic Dutch defense.While White controls the e5 square,Black controls the
e4 square}
2.Nc3!? {A very interesting variation.Here White is looking at an anti-Dutch scheme where pushing e4 immediately is the main motif}
2...d5 {Black's best alternative that does not allow White from playing 3.e4. Black adds more steel on the e4 square but the light-squared Bishop on c8 is looking ugly and will not find it easy to develop}
3.Bf4!? {White is playing in the spirit of the London system. The Bishop is now eyeing the "hole" on e5 and also threatening to play Nb5 and capture the c7 pawn with a
dangerous initiative}
3...a6!? {A weird looking move but important in the context of the game. Preventing Nb5 is a priority}
4.e3 {White will now develop the kingside after Be2 or Bd3 followed by Nf3}
4...Nf6 {Black needs to develop pieces and not just play pawn moves}
5.Bd3 {White develops the Bishop and attacks the f5 pawn}
5...e6 {Protects the pawn on f5 and prepares ...c5}
6.Nf3 {Classical development from White}
6...c5 {Black gets his share of the central squares}
7.dxc5 {White gives up the d-pawn for the flank c-pawn with ideas like Na4 and c4 on the cards.The move c4 allows White to attack the Black's light-squared pawn chain complex}
7...Bxc5 {Black develops a piece after capturing the pawn.}
8.O-O {White completes the Kingside development}
8...O-O {Black too follows suit and ensures his King's safety}
9.Ne2 {White intends to push c4 and also play Nd4 at an appropriate time to pressurise Black's backward pawn on e6}
9...Nc6{Black does not allow Nd4 for the moment by developing the KnightAlso ...Nb4 is possible now for Black and threaten to eliminate White's Bishop pair.So far so good for Black in this risky defense}
10.c4 {White pushes according to plan by attacking the central d5 pawn.White aims to disrupt Black's pawn structure and open up the central d-file.}
10...Nb4 {Attempting to eliminate White's Bishop pair as the light-squared Bishop is an important piece for White. In hindsight, it appears that 5.Be2 instead of 5.Bd3 as played in the game would have been
more precise as the Bishop would have survived.
10...dxc4 11.Bxc4 and with ideas like Qb3,Ned4,Ng5 White would aim to pile up pressure on the backward e6 pawn.
11...b5 12.Bb3 Na5 attacking the powerful Bishop again.12.Rc1 Qxd1 13.Bxd1 Ba7 gives White an advantage due to excellent space and the Bishop pair }
11.a3 {Perhaps not the most precise move as the Knight on b4 is interested in capturing the light-squared Bishop on d3. White is aiming now to gain more space on the
Queenside with b4 attacking the Bishop on c5. 11.Be5 vacating the f4 square for the Knight on e2 to pile up pressure on the e6 pawn.
11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.Bb1 would have helped White to preserve the light-squared Bishop as it would have played an important role in
undermining Black's d5-e6-f5 pawn complex.}
11...Nxd3 {11...Nc6 is timid as Black achieves nothing. 12.Rc1 and Black's Bishop on c5 would have to move back to d6.12...Bd6 13.b4 and White gains lot of space on the
Queenside}
12.Qxd3 {Forced}
12...a5 {Not allowing 13.b4}
13.Ned4 {White begins his plan to pile up pressure on the backward e6 pawn}
13...dxc4 {Black gives up the central pawn for the flank pawn.13...b6 is another quiet move worth playing vacating the b7 square for the Bishop on c8.}
14.Qxc4 Qd5 {Black supports the attacked Bishop and offers a trade of Queens}
15.Qc3 {White refrains from exchange.15.Qe2 or 15.Qc2 was perhaps slightly better with the intention of playing moves
like Rad1 and e4 soon.15.Qe2 b6 intending to play ...Ba6 and win the exchange after White moves the Queen
16.Rfd1 Bb7 and White is slightly better}
15...Bxd4 {The dark-squared Bishop eliminates a potential nemesis to the backward e6 pawn and Black gives up the Bishop pair }
16.Qxd4 {Not 16.exd4?! because White then gets an isolated pawn on the d-file. 16.Nxd4?? loses to 16...e5! and the weak backward pawn suddenly
lands Black with an extra piece}
16...Qxd4 {Black opts for a trade of Queens and another possible nemesis for the e6 pawn is eliminated}
17.Nxd4 {Both sides now have two pawn islands with similar pawn structure and opposite colored Bishops.}
17...Bd7 {Connecting both the Rooks and developing the Bishop}
18.Rac1 {Develops the Rook on the open c-file.Hoping to occupy the seventh rank via the c7 square.}
18.Rfc8 {Diluting White's intentions}
19.Be5 {White occupies the hole on e5 and threatens to play Bxf6 and double up the pawns on b-file. }
19...Kf7 {The Black King supports the Knight as Black cannot afford to have a bad pawn structure after 20.Bxf6 gxf6}
20.Rfd1 {White brings out the last piece into the game. Better was 20.f3 to deny the Knight on f6 good squares.WHite has not made good use of the earlier space advantage}
20...Rxc1 {Trading Rooks and getting closer to an easy draw}
21.Rxc1 {Forced}
21...Rc8 {Offering the exchange of the remaining Rook}
22.Rxc8 Bxc8 {Black succeeds in getting an easy endgame with opposite-coloured Bishops and identical pawn islands}
23.f3 {Denying the Knight on f6 useful squares like g4 and e4}
23...b6{Black consolidates his b-pawn.The position looks like a dead draw with accurate play from both sides}
24.Nb5 {Threatening Nd6+ forking the King and the Bishop on c8}
24...Ba6 {Attacking the Knight and foiling the fork}
25.Nc3 {The Knight goes back and White's attacking potential has now fizzled out}
25...Nd7 {Attacking the Bishop and protecting the b6 pawn at the same time.It is also important for Black to aim for ...e5 pawn push and inject some life into this endgame.}
26.Bc7 {The Black's Knight has to keep guarding the pawn on b6 for the moment.}
26...Bb7 {Preparing ...Bc6 followed by ...a4.Black can also push ...e5. The Bishop move blocks the access on the d5 square for the Knight }
27.Kf2 {The King comes out to aid his troops.White does not have anything better and must wait for Black's response}
27...Bc6{Preparing ...a4 followed by ...b5 and thus freeing the Knight on d7 from defensive duties. Black can play ...e5 later}
28.Ke2{The King strolls towards the central squares.28.b3 was perhaps slightly better in order to prevent ...a4}
28...a4 {Preparing ...b5 on the next move to free the Knight for action}
29.Kd3 {White improves the Kin's position further}
29...b5 {The Knight is now freed from the defence of the b-pawn as Kc4 is also prevented}
30.Ne2 {Preparing Nd4 to centralise the Knight and attack the Bishop}
30...Bd5 {30...e5?! is not good now as 31.Kc3 Ke6 32.Kb4 is good for White as the Knight will comew back to c3 and attack the pawn on b5 lacking support}
31.Kd4 {The King comes further into the territory}
31...g5 {Waiting move}
32.Nc3 {Attacking the Bishop again}
32...Bc6 {Safe square and Black keeps all the tension intact}
33.Be5 {White wants Black to grab the Knight and make a mistake}
33...Kg6 {Black is uninterested in the capture because 33...Nxe5? 34.Kxe5 Ke7 35.Ne2! and with moves like Nd4 in the offing Black will invariably lose in the endgame}
34.e4 {Offering a pawn exchange.}
34...h5 {Expanding on the Kingside.Black plays simple chess and waits for any slip up from White}
35.Nd1 {Nice cat-and-mouse game.White waits}
35...Kf7 {Black is too happy to keep up the tension going}
36.Nf2{After a futile stint on the Queenside the Knight is back to the Kingside}
36...Kg6 {The King keeps dancing on the two squares f7 and g6!}
37.Nd3 {The Knight is now repositioned on a good square}
37...fxe4 {Black releases the tension and goes for the draw available}
38.fxe4 h4 {Black expands further with the dark-squared Bishop stuck on e5 and not having the g3 square on account of this move }
39.Bc7 {White is trying to squeeze oil out of stone here}
39...Kh5 {Black is crying out loudly to take a draw!}
40.Bd8 {The dormant Bishop creates pressure on the g5 pawn.A valiant attempt to squeeze a victory}
40...Kg6 {Black's King is the sole master of the f7-g6-h5 squares and can keep hopping and jumping here!}
41.Ne5+ {White decides to go for simplification and end the tussle}
41...Nxe5 42.Kxe5 Kh5 {The Boss is back on the h5 square!}
43.h3 {The last pawn move for White and after that only the Bishop can move aimlessly}

44.Be7 {White has tried his best to win.But Black has been solid throughout}
44...Bb7 {Now the Bishop begins the dance on the b7 and c6 squares! Completely drawn position}
45.Bb4 {Now the pawn on g5 will be attacked from the Bishop on d2.Futile attempt}
45...Bc6 {Keep waiting}
46.Bd2 {White's last attempt to win a drawn ending}
46...Bb7 {The dance of the Bishop is staggering!!}

1.e4 {The King pawn opening.}
1...c5 {White's King pawn opening is answered by the aggressive Sicilian defense}
2.Nf3 {The open Sicilian where White believes in active piece development followed by a blistering attack on the Black King}
2...g6 {The hyper-accelerated Dragon variation where the King's bishop will eye the long dark diagonal from g7}
3.d4 {White claims his stake in the centre.A theoretical move}
3...cxd4 {Black exchanges his flank c-pawn for White's central d-awn and opens up the c-file for his Rook}
4.Qxd4 {4.Nxd4 is considered more appropriate. The move played is more of a surprise}
4...Nf6 {Black develops a piece and evades the threat to the rook on h8}
5.e5 {White grabs more space in the centre and kicks the Knight}
5...Nc6 {Black develops the other Knight with a tempo on the Queen}
6.Qa4 Nd5 {Both players take evasive action by playing textbook moves}
7.Qe4 {The White Queen is hyper-active and threatens the Knight}
7...Nc7 {7...Ndb4 looks outrageous as the Knight will be kicked around.7...Nb6 is another option but 7...Nc7 does not
block the pawn on b7 that has an important role to play in the Queenside expansion.}
8.Nc3
8...Bg7 {Both sides develop further with White taking out his Queen-side pieces first}
9.Bf4!? {White intends to castle long and then launch a pawn storm on the kingside - a typical idea in the Sicilian}
9...Ne6 {The knight jumps again to swap the Bishop on f4 that is an important piece in White's arsenal}
10.Bg3 {White protects the Bishop}
10...O-O {Black houses his King to safety but White's active pieces are ready for an assault}
11.O-O-O {White castles long and both sides are ready for a full-blooded Sicilian battle}
11...Qa5 {The rook and the Queen are on the same d-file. This move not only ensures the safety of the Queen but the
attack on the advanced e5 pawn is increased by one. Now Black has attackers on the e5 pawn while White has three defenders.
Black soon plans to push ...d6 and attack the pawn again. This would increase the potency of the dragon Bishop and the influence on the
c3 square will also increase - an important motif in the Sicilian dragon variations.}
12.h4 {White begins his kingside pawn march. h5 followed by hxg6 is a typical idea to open up the h-file}
12...Nc5 {Attacking the White Queen again and vacating the e6 square for the Bishop on c8 to come into play}
13.Qe3 {The Queen moves to a safe square and also guards the Knight on c3}
13...d6{Black cannot expect to counterattack or defend well without involving the light-squared Bishop and the Queen's Rook on a8. This move opens up the '
h3-c8 diagonal and allow the Bishop to go to f5 or e6}
14.h5 {White advances with an intention of opening up the h-file after hxg6}
14...Be6 {There are two good squares for the light-squared Bishop here. 14...Bf5 allows White to play 15.Bc4! attacking the
f7 pawn. The a2-f7 diagonal is now well guarded by White's Bishop.Black can then play 15...Rac8 with an X-ray attack on the c3 Knight.
16.hxg6 Bxg6 17.exd6 Bxc3 18.Qxc3 exd6 is also okay for Black}
15.hxg6 hxg6 {It is important for Black not to capture 15...fxg6 because 16.Ng5! attacks the light-squared Bishop and the pawn on h7 simultaneously.Black's king's kingise wall of pawns will collapse
after 16...Bxa2 17.Rxh7 and White has a decisive advantage}
16.exd6 {16.Bf4 is actually the strongest engine move. White missed it because it is difficult to spot its utility.White does not have a
pawn storm on the Kingside thanks to the Bishop on g3.Also the light-squared Bishop is undeveloped thanks to Black's last move
Bf4 would have allowed White with a potent threat of Bh6 threatening to eliminate Black's dragon Bishop and weakening the
dark squares around the King.The White pawn on e5 would have blocked Black Bishop's prowess down the g7-a1 diagonal.
16.Bf4 dxe5 17.Bh6! Bf6 not exchanging the Bishop 18.Bxf8 grabbing the exchange with complicated play.Perhaps White saw this
and was not sure about his chances}
16...Bxa2 {White's main threat is 17.Bb5 which will make the Black Knight on c5 a hanging piece.
16...exd6? is bad because 17.Bxd6 threatening to win the Knight on c5 and also attacking the Rook on f8. Black will have to give up the exchange
17...Na4 18.Bxf8 Rxf8 19.Nxa4 Qxa4 20.Qa3! and White is winning
16...Rfe8 17.Bb5 with the idea of cutting off the support to the Knight on c5. 17...exd6 18.Bxd6 attacking the Knight on c5 twice.
18...Bxc3 19.Qxc5! Bg7 20.Bxc6 Qxc5 21.Bxc5 bxc6 and White is not only a pawn up but also with the better pawn structure}
17.Bb5 {White puts his dormant Bishop to work by cutting off the support to the Knight on c5.Qxc5 is a threat}
17...Nb3+ {The Knight has no good square.17...Ne6?? loses to 18.Bxc6 bxc6 18.dxe7 Rfe8 19.Be5! and the dark squares around the Black King become weak.
17...exd6?? is also bad as 18.Bxc6 bxc6 19.Bxd6 attacking the Knight on c5 and the Rook on f8 simultaneously.
19...Nb3+ 20.cxb3 Bxb3 21.Nfd2 Bxd1 22.Bxf8 is also winning for White}
18.cxb3 {Only move}
18...Bxb3 {Bishop captures the pawn and attacks the Rook on d1. Black will get a Rook and pawn in return for two minor pieces.
White still has the edge after this happens}
19.Nd2 {White redirects his Knight and attacks the b3 square.19...Qb1+ can also be blocked by 20.Nb1 and White looks better}
19...Bxd1 {The whole point behind the Knight sacrifice on move 17.Blacks gets a Rook and pawn for two minor pieces but White is slightly better}
20.Bxc6 {20.Rxd1 Bxc3 21.cxb3 Qxb5 and Black is equal White's Bishop goes off the board but takes along Black's Knight as it had no support}
20...exd6 {Black removes the wedge pawn on d6.20...bxc6? 21.dxe7! Re8 22.Nxd1 Qb4 23.Re1 and White's pawn on e7 becomes an albatross around Black's neck.The defense would become tedious and almost lost}
21.Nc4!? {Nice move.21.Rd1 looks too obvious but White improves the position of the Knight and attacks the Black Queen}
21...Qa1+ {Queen escapes with a check}
22.Kd2 {Only move}
22...bxc6 {Now Black can take the Bishop as the pawn wedge is gone.Black will also lose his light-squared Bishop on d1}
23.Rxd1 {White takes back the Bishop with a tempo on the Black Queen}
23...Qa6 {Only square}
24.Nxd6 {The Knight now occupies an annoying square to tame Black's chances}
24...Rad8 {Pinning the Knight and activating the Rook.24...Rfb8 or 24...Rab8 with an idea of attacking the b2 pawn with moves like ...Qa5 followed by ...Qb4 is too slow.
Instead, 25...Rfb8 26.Kc2 Qb6 27.Qxb6 bxa6 and Bl;ack seems to have improved his pawn structure.But then 27.Nde4 Re8 28.Rd6 and White's Rook is menacing enough to gobble up both Black's pawns
This is slow poison for Black and Black's Rook versus two minor pieces does not look too promising for a draw}
25.Kc2 {King moves to a safer square}
25...Rd7 {Preparing ...Rfd8 to double the Rooks on the d-file.}
26.Qe4 {Does not look like a good move.White aims to play Be5 and tame Black's Bishop.White instead, should have done his bit to get the Black Queen off the board
26.Bf4! was excellent as ...Rfd8 can be met with Bg5! on the next move. 26...Rfd8 27.Bg5 Rb8 28.Qh3! and White has a huge advantage.
The Black pawn on e6 is safe at the moment thanks to the Queen on a6.White, in my opinion, has missed out on a chance to squeeze Black with a slow positional grind.Moreover,The b6 square is now available for the Black Queen to look for a counter-punch on the b-file and exchange the b-pawn}
26...Rfd8 {Vacating the f8 square for the King.Black doubles the Rooks on the d-file and puts more pressure on the Knight}
27.Qg4!? {A cunning move that disallows Black from playing ...Rb8. The Rook on d7 is now stuck.White can also aim to play Nce4 and create a strong outpost on d6.}
27...Qb6 {Black's dormant Queen needs to salvage the situation.Nce4 is prevented as the b3 pawn can then be grabbed with ...Qxb2+
27...Bxc3 is not encouraging as 28.Kxc3 Qa5+ 29.Qb4! and Black has to exchange Queens as the Queen has no good squares on the board to launch a counter-attack}
28.Nc4 {White Knight attacks the Queen again with a double-attack on the d7 Rook forcing liquidation and a better endgame}
28...Qb7 {The only move that protects the Queen and the Rook on d7}
29.Rxd7 {Forcing exchange}
29...Qxd7 {29...Rxd7?? 30.Nd6!! attacking the Black Queen and the Black Rook has to go. 30...Rxd6 31.Bxd6 and White is a piece up}
30.Qxd7 {White trades Queens as Black's Queenside pawns are isolated and are up for grabs.Difficult defence for Black}
30...Rxd7 {Black has rook and a pawn against two Knights but the c-pawn will fall soon}
31.Na5 {White starts the pawn hunt}
31...c5 {Has Black got anything better? The aim is to push the pawn to c4 and then once it falls bring the Black King to a centralised position}
32.Nb3 {White is relentless in his pursuit of the pawn on c4}
32...c4 {Black pushes forward.Another move for Black is 32...Bf8 but then White has the move Bf4 and Be3 forcing Black to push ...c4.In this case White's Bishop would have improvedits position and with the pawn on a7 under fire Black's Rook would have to play a passive role.
Pushing ...a5 would be suicide for Black as the King and the Knights can combine to win the pawn on a5 thereby creating the passed pawn on b2}
33.Nd2 {White's Knight goes back and is now threatening to capture the pawn on c4 with a great advantage in the endgame.}
33...f5 {Black vacates the f7 square for the King.Black's King will have to walk to the other side of the board and block the b-pawn from Queening.Tough job}
34.Nxc4 {White gobbles the pawn and a great advantage.}
34...g5{34...Kf7 is hasty because after 35.Ne5+ Bxe5 36.Bxe5 White is better because the Black Rook has an arduous task of defending against the Bishop and Knight pair.The dark-squared Bishop will cover 50 percent squares on the board leaving Black in trouble}
35.Bd6 {Good move.Black was threatening to nullify White's advantage with ...f4.Black's Rook is now restricted}
35...Bf8 {Important for Black to get the Bishops off the board. A rook versus two Knights looks more playable}
36.Bxf8 Kxf8 {Black now has to deal with the Knight pair}
37.Ne5 {Attacking the Rook now}
37...Rd6 {The Rook protects itself and prepares the maneouvre Rd6-a6-a1 infiltrating White's position and then attack the White pawns from behind and checking the White King if possible}
38.Nf3 {Attacking the pawn on g5}
38...g4 {Pushing the pawn deeper into the White's territory}
39.Ne5 {The Knight is jumping and hopping but Black will have to continuosly look at the headache of a fork}
39...Kg7 {King will slowly walk down the board closer to the pawns}
40.g3 {Nice move tempting Black to push ...Kf6}
40...Rd8 {Black waits}
41.Nc6 {Forking the Rook and pawn but not a serious threat.41.b4 was perhaps better in order to increase Black's headache}
41...Rd7{Evading both the threats}
42.Ne2 {Improving the Knight's position}
42...Rc7 {Pinning the Knight. Black's main idea lies in utlising the Rook to keep both the Knights tied down and in between move the King closer to the centre}
43.Ned4 {Forced}
43...Kf6{Improving the King's position}
44.Kd3 {White follows suit with his King and unpins the Knight}
44...a6 {Black cannot afford the move b5 after White makes the move b4}
45.Nb4 {The Knight goes back and attacks the pawn on a6}
45...Rd7 {Pinning the Knight and denying White the chance to play 46.Nxa6 because 46...Ke5! wins the pinned Knight}
46.Kc4 {Unpinning the Knight and Nxa6 is threatened again}
46...Rc7+ {Preventing Nxa6 for the moment}
47.Ndc6{White covers the check}
47...Ke6 {Centralising the King further}
48.Kd4 {The Knight on c6 is unpinned and White again threatens to play Nxa6 on the next move}
48...Rc8 {Keeping the pressure on the Knight on c6.}
49.Kc5 {White's aggression continues.Slightly better was Ke3 because now all three pieces are far away from the g3-f2 pawn duo}
49...Rh8{The Rook will now go to a1 via h1 and look to make life difficult for White}
50.Nd3 {The Knight comes back to the rescue of the pawn on g2}
50...Rh1 {A very hard position for Black to play. The Rook will go behind the passed b-pawn of White and also attack the Knights from behind
who are close to uniting with each other.}
51.Nd4+{Asking the King to decide his future course of action before the Knights regroup}
51...Kf6 {Protecting the pawn on f5 is also necessary}
52.b4 {Passed pawn is pushed}
52...Rh7 {Black Rook keeps its flexible and waits}
53.Ne2 {Improving the position of the Knight}
53...Rh1 {The Rook stays put on the h-file waiting for White to play}
54.Nec1 {The Knight blocka access to the a1 square}
54...Rh6 {Controlling the sixth rank and protecting the pawn on a6 indirectly}
55.Kb6 {The King will try to gobble the Black pawn on a6 and help the b4 pawn to the b8 square}
55...Kg5+ {The King remains closer to the pawns and the Rook gives a check}
56.Ka5 {The pressure on the a6 pawn is intact}
56...Rc6 {Black keeps the pressure on the Knight duo}
57.Nc5 {The Knight blocks and Black's defence is tight here}
57...f4 {Black decides to exchange pawns and prolong the defence}
58.Ne2 {Supporting the g3 pawn}
58...fxg3 59.fxg3 Kf6 {Improving the position of the King}
60.Nd4 Rc8 {The attacked Rook is defended}
61.Kxa6* {Black's last pawn hope is also gone}

1.Nf3 Nf6 {White's Zukertort opening is answered symetrically by Black}
2.c4 {A good move with rich strategic possibilities. This move controls the d5 square}
2...e6 {Black controls the d5 square but blocks the Queen's Bishop in the process}
3.g3 {White decides to fianchetto the King's Bishop and control the light squares on the long diagonal}
3...d5 {Black too decides to adopt a light-square strategy.}
4.Bg2 {White follows up with his plan}
4...Nc6!? {An interesting move that seems to be on the unconventional side.4...Nbd7 was perhaps better because ...c5 or ...c6 would have been playable.
This move actually blocks the c-pawn.4...Be7  was another excellent choice}
5.O-O {White completes the king-side development}
5...dxc4 {Black grabs the pawn on offer as the light-squared Bishop is on g2.This is not a pawn-sacrifice by White as the next move suggests}
6.Qa4 {White intends to capture Qxc4 soon and regain the pawn}
6...Nd7 {Black's aim is to push e5 if 7.Qxc4 is played}
7.Qxc4 {White gets back the pawn}
7...Nb6?! {Not a good move.Although it looks that Black has just gained a tempo on the White Queen, actually Black
has reduced his defensive pieces on the King side.}
8.Qc3!? {White's Queen evades the threat but prevents Black from develop his dark-squared Bishop}
8...f6?! {Another weak move that weakens the Kingside.Better was 8...Bd7 }
9.d4 {Central control with a pawn without breaking a sweat is always good!}
9...Be7 {Black develops the Bishop and intends to castle on the Kingside}
10.e4 {White expands in the centre with another central pawn-push to the best possible square}
10...O-O {Black completes his development on the Kingside}
11.Be3 {White too brings out the Bishop with an intention of bringing his Queen's Knight to d2 soon}
11...Bd7 {Simple Development}
12.Nbd2 {White too develops}
12...Qe8{Black's Queen will probably land on h5 to grab a Kingside initiative.The d8 square has also been vacated for the Rook to come into play.Good chess}
13.Rfc1 {White is looking for a Queenside expansion.Bringing the King Rook to the semi-open c-file is the first step towards that goal}
13...Qh5 {Black makes his intentions clear.Looking for a Kingside initiative.White must be careful and not pursue his Queenside expansion blindly}
14.Qb3 {Black's Kingside chances increase when both the Bishops will have strong diagonals to play with. Currently Black can free
the Bishop e7 by pushing f5.Both the Black Knights are on the Queenside and do not gel with Black's intentions on the Kingside.
The White Queen pins the pawn on e6 preventing ...f5}
14...Na5 {Not in sync with the Kingside offensive. This Knight does not achieve anything by attacking the White Queen. The Knight will have to go back from the rim and
reposition itself for better purposes after White moves the Queen. Better would have been 14...Rad8 bringing the Rook into the game}
15.Qc2 {After Black plays ...f5 to try and free his position then the White Queen will have an important role to play via the e4 square. The Queen on c2 can achieve that purpose.Also the c7 pawn is under fire}
15...Rac8 {Protecting the pawn on c7}
16.a3 {With ideas like b4 in the next couple of moves,White intends to grab more space on the Queenside and keep Black busy}
16...Ba4?! {Provoking the White Queen. Bringing another piece onto the Queenside without any concrete idea.Black's pieces are increasingly getting
out of sync with each other.Better would have been 16...Nc6 and the Knight could have been redirected
for better purposes in the centre and the Kingside.The Black Queen on the Kingside is pleading for her troops to join for action but the light-squared Bishop has just defied her wish and looked elsewhere! }
17.b3 {Forcing the Bishop back and Black is forced to lose yet another tempo}
17...Be8{The Bishop goes back}
18.b4 {Grabbing more space on the Queenside with tempo}
18...Nc6 {Black loses yet another move in order to resurrect his position}
19.b5! {White attacks the Knight again but offers the pawn as a sacrifice to open up lines.Another good move was 19.Nb3 improving the position of the Knight and
 then moving it to the c5 square}
19...Qxb5 {The Queen accepts the pawn sacrifice 19...Nd8 or 19...Nb8 is followed by 20.a4 and Black is getting choked}
20.a4 {Attacking the Queen and also preparing a5}
20...Qh5 {The Queen is back to the Kingside}
21.a5 {Another pawn on offer for Black.White wants to open up the a-file}
21...Nd7 {Black declines the offer sensing trouble. Black's only piece beyond the third rank is the Queen lacking support}
22.a6! {White pushes the pawn deeper into the territory.The threat is axb7 removing the defender of the Knight on c6.}
22...Nb4 {Attacking the Queen and also the pawn on a6.It looks like White made a faulty choice on move 19}
23.axb7! {Threatening to Queen after bxc8! because after 23...Nxb4 24.bxc8=Q Nxa1 24.Qxc7! and the Knight on a1 is trapped.Black loses a whole Knight}
23...Rb8 {Black avoids the capture of the Queen and instead protects the Rook.But the lack of coordination of the pieces will haunt Black}
24.Qxc7 {The White Queen gobbles a pawn and soon Black's position will fall apart.The a7 pawn is next on the target list}
24...Bd8 {Attacking the Queen now}
25.Qc8! {Another good move is Qc4 with a double-attack on the e6 pawn and the Knight on b4}
25...a5 {Protecting the pawn on a7 now from the Queen on h5}
26.Bf4! {Attacking the Rook on b8. 26.d5 was also a healthy option cutting off the support to the pawn on a5.26.d5 exd5 27.Ba7! is also a great possibility}
26...e5 {A temporary pill for Black}
27.dxe5 {White removes the pawn and threatens to push e6 and attack the defender of the Rook on b8.Black resigns as the difficulties look insurmountable}1-0

1.Nf3 Nf6 {White opens with the flexible Zukertort opening and Black copies the same idea}
2.c4 {White intends to take the game into the maze of variations from the English opening}
2...c5 {Another symmetrical response preventing White from playing d4}
3.g3 {White is content developing the king-side and keeps his plans under wrap}
3...Nc6 {Another move that solidifies the pressure on the d4 square.}
4.Nc3 {White strengthens his grip on the d5 square.}
4...d5!? {Never miss an opportunity to control the centre in the opening.The threat is to play ...d4}
5.d4 {Another idea for White would have been to capture with 5.cxd5 and have two central pawns.5...Nxd5 6.Bg3 Nxc3 7.bxc3 and the game is fairly equal}
5...cxd4 {Black eliminates one of White's two central pawns.5...e6 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 with fairly equal chances}
6.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}
6...e5! {Control the centre,attack the knight and free the f8-b4 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop.Black's chess is solid and based on classical
principles}
7.Nxc6 {The knight cannot go back to f3 as Black will seize the initiative with ...7.d4 8.Nd5 Nxd5 9.cxd5 Bb4+ 10.Bd2 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Qxd5 and Black's centralised Queen is looking excellent}
7...bxc6 {Forced exchange}
8.Bg2 {At last White is able to exceute his fianchetto idea. The Black central pawn on d5 is now attacked four times and defended thrice}
8...Rb8!? {The g2-a1 diagonal is poisonous for Black as White's King Bishop is a strong piece.Black occupies the semi-open b-file
making the development of White's dark-squared Bishop difficult.8...Be6 was another option as the fourth defender.The move played is provocative as Black is willing to sacrifice a pawn for an initiative}
9.Bg5!? {White develops another piece ignoring the pawn on b2}
9...Rxb2 {Black accepts the offer}
10.O-O {White castles on the kingside and brings out the Rook into action}
10...Qa5!? {Black continues with his attacking ideas and threatens the Knight on c3. Black must remember that the attack will backfire if his King stays on e8.}
11.Qc1 {Nice move.The Queen attacks the Rook and also protects the attacked Knight. The Rook has to retreat back}
11...Rb4 {The only good move for Black because this comes with the threat of ...Rxc4 on the next move.
11...Rb8? 12.Bxf6! gxf6 13.cxd5 cxd5?? 14.Nxd5 with the threat of Nxf6+ and Black is ripped apart.}
12.cxd5 {White grabs a pawn and parries the threat of ...Rxc4}
12...Rc4 {Black continues with his aggression and threatens to grab the Kinight on c3}
13.Qb1! {Excellent move.White decides to exploit Black's central King on e8 by threatening Qb8.Qb8 allows White to get back into the game with an attack on the e5 pawn after Qxe5+
13...Rxc3 14.Qb8 Qa6? 15.Qxe5+! Be7 16.d6 and White has a huge advantage after the Bishop on e7 is lost.
13...Qxc3 allows 14.Rxc3 Qb4 15.Rxc4 Qxc4 16.Qb8 Qg4 17.Qe5+ allowing White a huge advantage}
13...Be7 {Important for Black to castle and dilute Qb8 ideas. This move clears the path to castle.Another move to consider was
13...Rb4 14.Qe1 Rc4 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Ne4 Qxe1 17.Rfxe1 Be7 18.dxc6 Rxc6 and Black is equal}
14.d6! {Nice move. White attacks the Bishop and invites him to capture ...Bxd6. 14...Bd8?! is bad after 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Ne4 pressurising the pawn on f6
16...O-O 17.Rfc1 is good for White as the pawn on d6 looks scary for Black}
14...Bxd6 {Black accepts the pawn}
15.Qd3 {Attacking both the Rook on c4 and the Bishop on d6.Black is forced to decide}
15...Rd4 {15...Rxc3 is another move that comes to mind where Black captures the Knight.16.Qxd6 Qc5 17.Qxc5 Rxc5 18.Be3 and White is better as the Bishop pair
dominate the board although with accurate play Black can ensure a draw}
16.Bxc6+ {White grabs the pawn with tempo}
16...Kf8 {Black cannot castle now which means the Rook on h8 will not come out easily}
17.Qe3 {White's Queen goes to a safe square.17.Qf3?! Bg4 18.Qe3 White would have a wasted a tempo in this variation as the Knight on c3 needs support}
17...h6 {Putting the question to the White Bishop.The White Bishop has to go or else will be trapped}
18.Bxf6 {No other move available for White}
18...gxf6 {Black eliminates White's Bishop pair but gets doubled pawns as a weakness in return}
19.Nb5 {The harrassed Knight now turns aggressor as it attacks both the Rook and the dark-squared Bishop simultaeously}
19...Rc4 {The Rook in turn attacks White's only Bishop and forces a series of exchanges}
20.Nxd6 {Nothing better}
20...Rxc6 {Black too gets the Bishop}
21.Nxc8 {The White Knight goes down fighting}
21...Rxc8 {Now only the major pieces are left on the board.White has a slight edge but the position is looking completely drawish}
22.Qf3 {Attacking the pawn on f6.White does not have any great advantage and the position is looking drawish.}
22...Kg7 {The Black King protects the pawn and connects the Rooks}
23.Qg4+ {Check that puts the Queen on an active square}
23...Kh7 {Forced.}
24.Rac1{White attacks the Rook on c8 twice but going deep it is clear that after
24...Rxc1 25.Rxc1 White has got a notorious idea of playing Rc6 that attacks the pawn on f6.Black cannot allow such headaches.
Also, the pawn on a2 is a bait as 25...Qxa2 allows 26.Rc6 with serious consequences for Black}
24...Qa6 {Supporting the attacked Rook is the best possible solution to the underlying poisonous intentions.Also White is not allowed the sixth rank infiltration as the Queen
protects this rank}
25.Rfd1 {White brings out the inactive Rook to join the action}
25...Rhg8 {Attacking the Queen}
26.Qf5+{White checks the King in response}
26...Kg7 {26...Kh8 is not good due to 27.Rxc8 Rxc8 28.Rd7 Kg7 and Black has to use all the available resources to protect pawns on f6,f7 and h6. The Black Queen remains stuck on a6 square as the White move Rd6 looms}
27.Rxc8 {White opts for simplification}
27...Qxc8 {Offering the trade of Queens.27...Rxc8 is also okay for Black}
28.Qd7 {Attacking the pawn on a7 and asking Black to trade the Queens such that the White Rook can occupy the seventh rank and win the pawn on a7}
28...h5 {Black allows White to accept the a7 pawn in return for activity and a quick end to the game on equal terms}
29.Qxc8 {29.Kg2 Qc2 is also okay where Black exerts some pressure on White}
29...Rxc8 {The Queens are traded in this drawn looking endgame}
30.Rd7 Rc2 {Both sides occupy their respective seventh ranks and are waiting to grab pawns.Dead drawn game in my opinion.}
31.Rxa7 Rxe2 {Both sides grab a pawn apiece}
32.Kf1 {Attacking the Rook}
32...Rb2 {Keeping the King tied on the first rank}
33.a4 {White starts pushing the passed pawn}
33...Ra2 {Always put the Rook behind the passed pawn - a general rule that should work in most of the cases}
34.a5 {Pushing the passed pawn further}
34...f5{Black improves his pawn position and vacates the f6 square for the King}
35.Ra8 {The path for the Queening square is being cleared but Black has adequate resources for equality}
35...e4 {Expanding in the centre}
36.a6 {Pushing further}
36...Kg6 {Waiting move. The King can hide on f6 whenever White plays a7}
37.a7 {White pushes the pawn further. Threatening Rg8+ followed by a8=Q}
37...Kf6 {The check is aborted and Black can wait. The last move from White ensures that the Rook is stuck on a8 defending the pawn}
38.h3 {White is utilising all moves up his sleeve to wait for Black to commit the fatal error}
38...Ke7 {The King is back on the seventh rank and avoids the silly mistake.}
39.Kg1 {The King starts dancing around now}
39...Kf6 {No Rook check.No issue}
40.Kg2 {Another waiting move but this allows Black an excellent shot}
40...e3{Black has now an great resource - the PIN - to end the game quickly.Threatening ...e2}
41.Re8 {White gives up the Queen hope on a8 and instead attacks the pawn on e3}
41...Rxa7 {Black is happy to force a drawish ending}
42.Rxe3 Ra4 {Preventing White pawns from stepping onto the fourth rank}
43.Kf3 h4 {Looking for pawn exchanges}
44.Rb3 Rc4 {Dead drawn grame}
45.Rb6+ Kg5
46.Rb3 Ra4
47.Rc3 hxg3
48.fxg3 Rb4 49.Rd3 {Draw agreed}1/2 - 1/2
