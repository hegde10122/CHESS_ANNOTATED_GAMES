1.Nf3 Nf6 {White opens with the flexible Zukertort opening and Black copies the same idea}
2.c4 {White intends to take the game into the maze of variations from the English opening}
2...c5 {Another symmetrical response preventing White from playing d4}
3.g3 {White is content developing the king-side and keeps his plans under wrap}
3...Nc6 {Another move that solidifies the pressure on the d4 square.}
4.Nc3 {White strengthens his grip on the d5 square.}
4...d5!? {Never miss an opportunity to control the centre in the opening.The threat is to play ...d4}
5.d4 {Another idea for White would have been to capture with 5.cxd5 and have two central pawns.5...Nxd5 6.Bg3 Nxc3 7.bxc3 and the game is fairly equal}
5...cxd4 {Black eliminates one of White's two central pawns.5...e6 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Bc5 with fairly equal chances}
6.Nxd4 {Forced recapture}
6...e5! {Control the centre,attack the knight and free the f8-b4 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop.Black's chess is solid and based on classical 
principles}
7.Nxc6 {The knight cannot go back to f3 as Black will seize the initiative with ...7.d4 8.Nd5 Nxd5 9.cxd5 Bb4+ 10.Bd2 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Qxd5 and Black's centralised Queen is looking excellent}
7...bxc6 {Forced exchange}
8.Bg2 {At last White is able to exceute his fianchetto idea. The Black central pawn on d5 is now attacked four times and defended thrice}
8...Rb8!? {The g2-a1 diagonal is poisonous for Black as White's King Bishop is a strong piece.Black occupies the semi-open b-file
making the development of White's dark-squared Bishop difficult.8...Be6 was another option as the fourth defender.The move played is provocative as Black is willing to sacrifice a pawn for an initiative}
9.Bg5!? {White develops another piece ignoring the pawn on b2} 
9...Rxb2 {Black accepts the offer}
10.O-O {White castles on the kingside and brings out the Rook into action}
10...Qa5!? {Black continues with his attacking ideas and threatens the Knight on c3. Black must remember that the attack will backfire if his King stays on e8.}
11.Qc1 {Nice move.The Queen attacks the Rook and also protects the attacked Knight. The Rook has to retreat back}
11...Rb4 {The only good move for Black because this comes with the threat of ...Rxc4 on the next move.
11...Rb8? 12.Bxf6! gxf6 13.cxd5 cxd5?? 14.Nxd5 with the threat of Nxf6+ and Black is ripped apart.}
12.cxd5 {White grabs a pawn and parries the threat of ...Rxc4}
12...Rc4 {Black continues with his aggression and threatens to grab the Kinight on c3}
13.Qb1! {Excellent move.White decides to exploit Black's central King on e8 by threatening Qb8.Qb8 allows White to get back into the game with an attack on the e5 pawn after Qxe5+
13...Rxc3 14.Qb8 Qa6? 15.Qxe5+! Be7 16.d6 and White has a huge advantage after the Bishop on e7 is lost.
13...Qxc3 allows 14.Rxc3 Qb4 15.Rxc4 Qxc4 16.Qb8 Qg4 17.Qe5+ allowing White a huge advantage}
13...Be7 {Important for Black to castle and dilute Qb8 ideas. This move clears the path to castle.Another move to consider was 
13...Rb4 14.Qe1 Rc4 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Ne4 Qxe1 17.Rfxe1 Be7 18.dxc6 Rxc6 and Black is equal}
14.d6! {Nice move. White attacks the Bishop and invites him to capture ...Bxd6. 14...Bd8?! is bad after 15.Bxf6 gxf6 16.Ne4 pressurising the pawn on f6
16...O-O 17.Rfc1 is good for White as the pawn on d6 looks scary for Black}
14...Bxd6 {Black accepts the pawn}
15.Qd3 {Attacking both the Rook on c4 and the Bishop on d6.Black is forced to decide}
15...Rd4 {15...Rxc3 is another move that comes to mind where Black captures the Knight.16.Qxd6 Qc5 17.Qxc5 Rxc5 18.Be3 and White is better as the Bishop pair 
dominate the board although with accurate play Black can ensure a draw}
16.Bxc6+ {White grabs the pawn with tempo}
16...Kf8 {Black cannot castle now which means the Rook on h8 will not come out easily}
17.Qe3 {White's Queen goes to a safe square.17.Qf3?! Bg4 18.Qe3 White would have a wasted a tempo in this variation as the Knight on c3 needs support}
17...h6 {Putting the question to the White Bishop.The White Bishop has to go or else will be trapped}
18.Bxf6 {No other move available for White}
18...gxf6 {Black eliminates White's Bishop pair but gets doubled pawns as a weakness in return} 
19.Nb5 {The harrassed Knight now turns aggressor as it attacks both the Rook and the dark-squared Bishop simultaeously}
19...Rc4 {The Rook in turn attacks White's only Bishop and forces a series of exchanges}
20.Nxd6 {Nothing better}
20...Rxc6 {Black too gets the Bishop}
21.Nxc8 {The White Knight goes down fighting}
21...Rxc8 {Now only the major pieces are left on the board.White has a slight edge but the position is looking completely drawish}
22.Qf3 {Attacking the pawn on f6.White does not have any great advantage and the position is looking drawish.}
22...Kg7 {The Black King protects the pawn and connects the Rooks}
23.Qg4+ {Check that puts the Queen on an active square}
23...Kh7 {Forced.}
24.Rac1{White attacks the Rook on c8 twice but going deep it is clear that after 
24...Rxc1 25.Rxc1 White has got a notorious idea of playing Rc6 that attacks the pawn on f6.Black cannot allow such headaches.
Also, the pawn on a2 is a bait as 25...Qxa2 allows 26.Rc6 with serious consequences for Black}
24...Qa6 {Supporting the attacked Rook is the best possible solution to the underlying poisonous intentions.Also White is not allowed the sixth rank infiltration as the Queen 
protects this rank}
25.Rfd1 {White brings out the inactive Rook to join the action}
25...Rhg8 {Attacking the Queen}
26.Qf5+{White checks the King in response}
26...Kg7 {26...Kh8 is not good due to 27.Rxc8 Rxc8 28.Rd7 Kg7 and Black has to use all the available resources to protect pawns on f6,f7 and h6. The Black Queen remains stuck on a6 square as the White move Rd6 looms}
27.Rxc8 {White opts for simplification}
27...Qxc8 {Offering the trade of Queens.27...Rxc8 is also okay for Black} 
28.Qd7 {Attacking the pawn on a7 and asking Black to trade the Queens such that the White Rook can occupy the seventh rank and win the pawn on a7}
28...h5 {Black allows White to accept the a7 pawn in return for activity and a quick end to the game on equal terms}
29.Qxc8 {29.Kg2 Qc2 is also okay where Black exerts some pressure on White}
29...Rxc8 {The Queens are traded in this drawn looking endgame}
30.Rd7 Rc2 {Both sides occupy their respective seventh ranks and are waiting to grab pawns.Dead drawn game in my opinion.}
31.Rxa7 Rxe2 {Both sides grab a pawn apiece}
32.Kf1 {Attacking the Rook}
32...Rb2 {Keeping the King tied on the first rank}
33.a4 {White starts pushing the passed pawn}
33...Ra2 {Always put the Rook behind the passed pawn - a general rule that should work in most of the cases}
34.a5 {Pushing the passed pawn further}
34...f5{Black improves his pawn position and vacates the f6 square for the King}
35.Ra8 {The path for the Queening square is being cleared but Black has adequate resources for equality}
35...e4* {Expanding in the centre}
