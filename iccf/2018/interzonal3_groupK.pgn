1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...d5 {Symmetrical response from Black}
2.c4 {The most popular response as White expands on the Queenside and

6.e3 {White opens the diagonal for the light-squared Bishop}
6...Be7 {Black unpins the Knight.However,6...Bf5 was perhaps more accurate as Black had lost the chance of playing ...c5 in one go.
Black's light-squared Bishop has problems occupying a good square in this variation.}
7.Bd3 {White prevents ...Bf5}
7...Nbd7 {Black develops without any worries and will most probably fianchetto the light-squared Bishop.Black also has the possibility of playing
...Nf8 followed by ...Nd6}
8.Bf4 {White redeploys the Bishop on the h2-b8 diagonal}
8...Nf8 {The Knight goes to the Kingside and will go to g6 before Black castles.}

1.Nf3 {The Zukertort Opening.A flexible opening where White does not commit any pawn on the opening move}
1...c5 {Usually White plays 2.c4 on the next move which would transpose into the symmetrical variation of the English opening}
2.c4 {Transposes to the English opening}
2...g6 {Black will control the dark squares on the long diagonal via the fianchetto of the King's Bishop}
3.d4 {A natural move because of the Knight on f3.This also gives White an open game instead of closed systems that are based on strategy and subtle maneouvring}
3...cxd4 {Black accepts the offer of having a 2-to-1 pawn majority in the centre}
4.Nxd4 {4.Qxd4 Nf6 followed by ...Nc6 is not good for White as he loses a tempo}
4...Nc6 {4...Bg7 5.e4 Nc6 6.Be3 and White is much more active.Hence this Knight move is much more precise}
5.e4 {We reach the Maroczy Bind position of the Sicilian Defense in the hyper-accelerated Dragon by transposition. This bind is actually about the
White's bind on the d5 square.White hopes to put up a Knight on this square and grind down Black}
5...Nf6 {Development with the threat of ...Nxe4}
6.Nc3 {6.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5? Qa5+ is good for Black}
6...d6{Preventing e5 after 7.Nxc6 bxc6 as the Knight on c3 blocks the check from the Black Queen}
7.Be2 {A solid move that controls the g4 square and prevents ...Ng4 such that White can play Be3,Qd2 and then launch a Kingside assault - a typical Sicilian idea}

8.Qxd4 {White accepts the exchange }
8...Bg7 {The dragon Bishop is now on the long dark-squared diagonal followed by O-O}

9...O-O {Black castles and threatens to play ...Ng4 thereby attacking the Queen}
10.Qd2 {White promptly goes back and creates the battery}

11...Qa5 {Black aims to play on the Queenside with moves like ...Rfc8,...a6 and ...b5 to attack the bind}
12.f3 {White tightens the light-square complex and delays castling.White has a vice-like grip on the e4 square and intends to play Nd5 or b3 followed by Na4 leading to an exchange of Queens}
12...Rfc8 {The King's Rook will participate in a Queenside expansion to counter White's central bind.Another important point is that the f8 square is cleared for the King in case of White moves like O-O and Nd5
If Black decides to exchange Queens with ...Qxd2 then the intermediate move Nxe7+ is not possible as ...Kf8 loses the White Knight}
13.b3 {Overprotecting the pawn on c4 and enhancing the "bind".The c-file is also "blocked" and disallow Black from seeking counterplay}
13...a6 {With the idea of pushing ...b5}

22.Ke1 {Attacking the Bishop on e6}
22...e6 {Protecting the Bishop. It is not an easy choice. 22...Rxc8 23.Rxc1 is too commital as Rc7 on the next move

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...Nf6 {The most popular response alongwith 1...d5.Black does not commit any pawns and keeps all options open.The Knight controls the
e4 and d5 squares}
2.c4 {White gains spance and controls the d5 square.All standard theory}
2...e6 {Black blocks his Queen's Bishop but decides to cement the control over the d5 square with the pawn}
3.Nc3 {White develops the Queen's Knight and threatens to play e4 with a massive centre}
3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence where Black creates two problems for White. (a) White cannot play e4 now as the Knight on c3 is pinned.(b) At some point Black
wants to play ...Bxc3 giving White doubled pawns.Black also clears the path for castling Kingside completing his development on the Kingside}
4.Qc2 {White plays the classical variation or the Capablanca variation wherein White aims to play a3 at some point and gaining the
Bishop pair after Black captures ...Bxc3.White aims to keeps his space advantage as playing e4 in the near future is still a ripe possibility
with the Queen guarding the e4 square.But more importantly, White aims to capture Qxc3 if Black were to play ...Bxc3 which will ensure that White's
pawn structure is not damaged. But the downside of theese Queen moves is that White will lag behind in development.}
4...d5 {An excellent move that threatens ...dxc4 and also indirectly attacks the d4 pawn by the Black Queen.}
5.a3{5.cxd5 is another popular option.5.Nf3 supporting the d4 pawn is not good for White as ...5.dxc4 6.e3 b5! is playable thanks to the pinned Knight on c3.Theory suggests that White has great difficulties
in recovering the pawn.Morever the pawn move e3 blocks White's dark-squared Bishop and White must waste more tempi to complete development.}
5...Bxc3+ {Black gives up the Bishop pair in exchange for rapid development}
6.Qxc3 {White captures without damaging his pawn structure}
6...O-O {Harmless. Much stronger move would have been 6...dxc4 7.Qxc4 and White has wasted one more move with the Queen.7...b6 with the idea of ...Ba6 and Black has a good initiative}
7.Bg5 {White develops with a pin on the Knight}
7...h6 {Black puts the question to the Bishop}
8.Bxf6 {Better than 8.Bh4 8...g5 9.Bg3 Ne4!? and Black has too much activity.Black win eventually eliminate White's Bishop pair
8.Bf4 is no good as 8...Nbd7 9.Nf3 c5 10.e3 b6 11.Bd3 Bb7 and Black is much better due to superior development}
8...Qxf6 {Doubling of pawns with 8...gxf6 is not healthy}
9.Nf3 {White needs to develop or else Black will start his counterplay}
9...dxc4 {Black forces White to make another Queen move}
10.Qxc4 {Now the c7 pawn is under attack but frankly speaking White has got nothing out of the opening}
10...Nc6 {Covers the c7 pawn}
11.Qc3 {Another Queen move from White.This time to cover the e5 square as Black will aim to push ...e5 and open up the central files}
11...Re8 {Preparing the e5 push after improving the position of the Rook}
12.Ne5 {White himself plays on the e5 square.To be fair White has not achieved anything great out of the opening.}
12...Rb8 {A nice move tempting White to capture the Knight. 13.Nxc6 bxc6 14.Qxc6? Bb7! 15.Qc3 e5! and Black has too much activity for the lost pawn}
13.e3 {White's King is stuck in the centre and it is wise to develop.Castling is important to deny Black couterplay.The Bishop is now free to go to e2}
13...Nxe5 {Black exchanges the piece and gives White doubled pawns}
14.dxe5 Qe7 {Protecting the pawn on c7}
15.Rc1 {Bringing out the Rook to exert further pressure on the c7 pawn}
15...Bd7 {The pawn cannot be taken as 16.Qxc7? Rec8 and Black will win material}
16.Be2 {White aims to castle in this increasingly drawish position where Black's solidity needs to be admired}
16...Bc6 {Nice logical move to exert more pressure on the g2 pawn}
17.O-O {No fuss.Easy chess }
17...Red8 {Black is solid}
18.f4 {Move that reinforces White's control over the central e5 square}
18...Rd7 {Black dishes out another strong move with an intention of doubling the Rooks on the d-file}
19.g3 {Just following a dark-square strategy}
19...Rbd8 {Black completes the sensible strategy}
20.Rfd1 {With an intention of liquidation}
20...Bd5 {Black blocks the attempt}
21.b4 {White gains more space on the Queen side}
21...f5 {Black locks the centre and strengthens his control on the e4 square}
22.exf6 {Breaking the stranglehold of Black on the centre with the pawn exchange}
22...gxf6 {Black does not exchange the pawn with the Queen suggesting that Black wants to create something out of the position}
23.b5 {Expanding on the Queenside}
23...c6{Black attacks the advanced pawn}
24.Kf2 {White waits}

25...cxb5 {Black goes for exchanges}
26.Bxb5 {Attacking the Rook now}
26...Bxc6{26...R7d6 would have maintained the tension}
27.Rxd7 {White is happy to simplify the position}

28.Bc4 {Putting pressure on the backward e6 pawn}
28...Rc8 {Pinning the Bishop and threatening ...b5}
29.Qb2 {Unpinning the Bishop and threatening Qxb7}
29...Be8 {The Queen now guards the b7 pawn}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...Nf6 {The Indian Defence.}
2.c4 {White expands in the centre and the flank pawn controls the d5 square}
2...g6 {Black now commits to develop the dark-squared Bishop on g7 and control the a1-h8 diagonal}
3.f3 {White plays a subtle move aimed at controlling the e4 square with pawn and push for e4 to get a massive centre.
Also this move takes the normal Grunfeld defence theory out of the window where Black can play ...d5 and challenge the centre. It introduces new imbalances and is quite sharp.
The third idea is to delay the development of the Knight on c3 keeping options open to go to d2.This is the Samisch variation}
3...Bg7 {Black places the dark-squared Bishop on the long diagonal and controls the d4 and e5 squares via a piece.}
4.e4 {White builds up a strong centre and gains space}
4...d6 {Black cannot afford to allow White to push e5 without any challenge.Black stops the e5 move.Now we have entered the King's Indian system another reliable defence for Black}
5.Nc3 {White has an iron-grip on the e4 and d5 squares and can play Nd5 later if Black is not careful.}
5...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development as White was busy with setting up a pawn centre}
6.Be3 {The Queen Bishop develops on a nice square and White can now plan to play O-O-O and launch a Kingside assault.The move f3 has ruled out ...Ng4 which could have harrased the Bishop on e3
White must keep this Bishop on the board for a long time as the dark-squares around the King will become weak if it were to be exchanged.}
6...c5 {A popular move that stakes a claim on the d4 square and Black is ready to play on the dark-squares.6...e5 is also good but has the disadvantage of closing the diagonal for the Bishop on g7.The move played in the game keeps the dark-squared Bishop active.
Black has actually offered a gambit because Black will lose a pawn after 7.dxc5 dxc5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8 9.Bxc5 But theory and practice have concluded that
White's extra pawn is no good and Black has excellent compensation in the form of superior development and the King's Indian Bishop on g7.}
7.Nge2 {The Knight keeps the tension in the centre and supports the d4 pawn. ...cxd4 Bxd4 ...Nxc6 and White's Bishop needs to go back losing a tempo. This Knight move allows White to
play Nxd4 if Black were to play ...cxd4}
7...Nc6 {Black develops the Knight on the natural square and provokes d5 to close the centre.The gambit is still possible for White to accept}
8.d5 {Better for White to close the centre and gain space in this position.The game obtains the colour of slow positional
maneouvring}
8...Na5 {8...Ne5 Occupying the central square and attacking the c4 pawn was much better.This Knight on the rim is not a prominent move but looks playable.
Black is building up moves like ...a6,...Bd7,...Rb8,...b5 with a Queenside expansion.}
9.Ng3 {White protects the pawn and prepares Be2}
9...a6 {A popular plan with Black eyeing a Queenside expansion.Good choice}
10.Rc1 {White aims to cover two of his weak squares - c4 and b2. White will play b3 later and overprotect the pawn on c4.The Rook on c1 will protect the
Knight on c3 from the King's Indian Bishop on g7.}
10...e6 {One of the many plans that Black has at his disposal.Black attacks the spearhead of the light-square pawn complex and will open up the e-file for his Rook
10...Bd7 was also another good option with an intention of pushing ...b5 hoping to get counterplay on the Queenside.The third aggressive option is to push
10...h5 with an intention of ...h4 to expand on the Kingside}
11.b3 {White removes the pawn from b2 since ...Qb6 could introduce the problem of defending the pawn on b2.White aims to play Qd2 followed by Bh6. This would not be possible with the pawn on b2}
11...b5 {Black offers to sacrifice a pawn in the quest for a Queenside initiative.11...exd5 was another option to remove the wedge pawn on d5. 12.cxd5 b5 was also possible}
12.cxb5 {White does not allow 12...b4 that would cramp White.White accepts the pawn on offer}
12...exd5 {Black removes the wedge pawn and alters the central pawn formation of White.12...axb5? 13.dxe6 b4 14.exf7+ Rxf7 15.Na4 Be6 and White is a healthy pawn up}
13.Nxd5 {13.exd5? is not a good move because after 13...Re8! pinning the Bishop on e3.14.Qd2 Bh6 15.Nge4 Bxe3 16.Qxe3 Nd7 threatening f5 to win the pinned Knight on e4.Then 17.g4 f5 18.gxf5 gxf5 White will be unable to save the pinned Knight and will have to play an inferior game probably with two pawns for a piece}
13...Nxd5{Black goes for simplication}
14.Qxd5 Be6 15.Qd2 axb5 16.Bxb5 Bxb3 17.axb3 Nxb3 18.Qd3 Nxc1
19.Bxc1 {Forced recapture }

30.Nxe5 f5 {Attacking the central pawn.}
31.Nc6 {White wants to play Nd4-Ne6. 31.Ke3 was also a good option}
31...fxe4 32.fxe4 {Another pair of pawns exchanged}
32...h5 {Pushing the passed pawn}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

8...Ba6!? {Nice move with an attempt to thwart White's central pawn pressure.Black develops smoothly}

15.dxc5 {Black would have captured the pawn on d4 himself with an open c-file}
15...Nxc5 {...bxc5 would give Black an isolated pawn on the c-file}
16.b4 {Expansion on the Queenside with tempo}
16...Nd7 {Best square for the Knight at the moment}
17.Bc3 {The Bishop is looking to occupy the c3-h8 diagonal}
17...Rac8 {The Knight on d5 is a better piece than the Bishop on c3 and hence Black decides to improve the position of the dormant Rook}
18.Qd3 {Unpinning the Bishop}
18...Ne5 {Attacking the Queen}
19.Bxe5 {White gets rid of the Knight but also his own Bishop which wasn't doing anything earth-shattering}
19...Qxe5 20.g3 {White cannot activate the Rook on h1 as the pawn on h2 is under the radar of the Black Queen on e5.The move played is in preparation to activate the Rook on h1}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...Nf6 {The Indian defense.Some believe that the name 'Indian'
for a defense is a reference to the Indian version of chess, in which pawns only
move one square forward, never two, so an 'Indian' defense is one in which the early
pawn moves are just one square. Another version of the story is that the name comes
from a player named Bannerjee Moheschunder, who regularly played 1...Nf6 in India
in the flrst half of the 1 9th century. Cannot predict which story is true.}
2.c4 {White expands and controls the d5 square}
2...e6 {Black too is eyeing the d5 square and prepares ...d5 at some point later}
3.Nc3 {White develops the Knight and threatens e4 with a massive centre}
3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian Defence}
4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation where White intends to play Bd3,Nf3 or Ne2 followed by O-O.The downside to the move is that White's dark-squared Bishop is blocked
on c1}
4...b6 {A popular response where Blacks intends to play ...Bb7 and exert pressure on the e4 square. ...Ba6 is also another reponse that Black can play depending on White's reply}
5.Nge2 {White supports the pinned Knight and will recapture with this Knight as soon as Black will play ...Bxc3}
5...Ba6 {Black attacks the c4 pawn.This is the best continuation for Black}
6.Ng3 {White Knight moves to a solid square without worrying about the doubling of the pawns on the c-file after ...Bxc3+
White instead aims to push e4 and earn a massive centre}
6...Bxc3+ {Black cannot push 6...d5?? 7.Qa4+ wins a piece.Black inflicts double pawns and prepares the ...d5 pawn push}
7.bxc3 {Forced capture}
7...d5 {Black keeps 8.e4 at bay}
8.Ba3?! {White denies Black the chance to castle on the Kingside and keeps the pawn on c4 as a sacrifice.Perhaps a better idea was to play
8.cxd5 Bxf1 9.Kxf1 Qxd5 and only then 10.Ba3 Here White is at least equal and can play on even terms }
8...dxc4!? {Black gives up the d5 square and accepts the bait winning a pawn.}
9.e4 {White occupies the centre with his central pawn duo gaining more space.Good old-school chess}
9...Qd7 {Black wants to castle on the Queenside.This move prevents moves like Qa4.Now Black can play ...Nc6 and clear the path for castling}
10.Be2 {White wants to castle and then try to gain an initiative}
10...Nc6 {Development of a piece with an intention to castle on the Queenside.Black is a pawn up and must try to justify it with some sharp chess}
11.O-O {Castling is the best way to safeguard the King}
11...O-O-O {Black does the same thing but on the other side}
12.Qc2 {In all likelihood White will bring the King's Rook to add pressure on the b-file}
12...h5 {Black puts the first step towards a Kingside infiltration. Opposite side castling means the time is ripe to begin an attack.The threat is ...h4}
13.Rfd1 {White clears the f1 square for the Knight which can gove to e3 via f1 and attack White's pawn on c4}
13...Ne7 {A quiet move that aims to take the Knight to g6 where both the Knights can work in tandem for a Kingside attack.The c6 square is vacated for the Queen.Qc6-Bb7 battery looks to be a good idea
White also cannot push h4 to halt Black's pawn march because after 14.h4 Ng6 Black wins the pawn on h4}
14.Bc1 {White senses trouble and brings back the Bishop to the original square from where Bg5 is a possible move}
14...h4 {Putting White on the defensive by sending the Knight back on the first rank}
15.Nh1 {The Knight goes to the corner of the board. Perhaps Nf1 was better as Ne3 would have allowed the Knight to fight in the centre}
15...Kb8 {The King improves his safety and waits}
16.f3 {Vacating the f2 square for the Knight}
16...Ne8 {The Knight will go to d6 and help Black to push ...f5}
17.Nf2 {The Knight comes back into the game.}
17...Nd6 {The Knight goes to the d6 square and will now aid Black to push ...f5 and expand on the Kingside.Also more protection is offered to the pawn on c4}

18...h3 {Looking to rip apart White's Kingside pawn structure}
19.g3 {19.gxh3? will open up lines for White and is dangerous}
19...Qe8 {The Queen will now join the attack. Moves like ...f5 are on the cards}
20.a4 {White aims to use the pawn on b6 as a hook to open up lines against the Black King. White is planning to push a5 followed by axb6}
20...f5 {Black is consistent with his aim of opening lines against the White King.The Knight on g4 is attacked and White
cannot push a5 soon}
21.Ne5 {Attacking the pawn on c4 now}
21...Nc6 {Offering to trade the nemesis on e5}
22.Bg5 {White is generating some counterplay by attacking the Rook}
22...Rc8 {Safeguarding the Rook} 
23.exf5 {White opens up the e-file }
23...exf5 {Black now threatens to win a pawn after ...Nxe5 dxe5 followed by ...Qxe5}
24.Bf4 {Protecting the Knight on e5 and averting the aforementioned threat}

24...Na5 {The Queen is now relieved of defensive duties and is ready to go to h5. Morever this Knight will act as an excellent defender on a5. The Black Bishop on a6 
can also come back to b7 and Black can begin a Kingside offensive}

25.Re1 {Improving the Rook's position}

25...Qh5 {Moving away from the White Rook's X-ray, the Queen wants to play a significant role on the Kingside. Black prepares ...Bb7 as the pawn on c4 is 
protected twice and does not need another defender on a6}

26.Rf1 {The Rook comes back to shore up the Kingside. 26.Rad1 followed by d5 made much more sense as White needs to close the h1- a8 diagonal}

26...Rce8 {Improving the position of the Queen's Rook}

27.Rae1 {Bringing the last piece into action}

27...Bb7 {Improving the position of the Bishop where it will play an active role in controlling the light squares}

28.Bd1 {Making room for the Rook on e3 followed by doubling of the Rooks on e-file}

28...Qh7 {Preventing White from pushing g4 with tempo}

29.Qc1 {Another calm move intending to play Bg5 followed by Qf4}

29...Bd5 {Black prepares to counter White's Rook occupation idea on the e-file with moves like ...Re6.This move controls the e6 square}
30.Rf2 {This Rook will probably go to e2 and White will increase the pressure of the Rooks on the e-file}
30...Kb7 {Waiting move}
31.Rfe2 {Doubling Rooks as planned}
31...g6 {Another waiting move}
32.Bg5 {Controlling e7 square and preventing ...Re7.The White Queen will probably come to f4}
32...Qg7 {Preventing 33.Bf6}
33.Bc2 {Another waiting move}
33...Ka8 {Vacating the b7 square for the Knight on a5 to make a come back into the game as White is simply playing a waiting game}
34.Qf4 Nab7 {Improving the Knight's position and preparing ...a5} 
35.Kf2 {Another waiting move.Also vacating he g1 square. Rg1,g4 are possible ideas}
35...Ref8 {Preventing  White from pushing g4 as the White Queen and King are on the f-file}
36.Kg1 a5 37.Qe3 {The Queen comes back anticipating ...Nd8 and ...Ne6 from Black }
37...Nd8 {The Knight wants to go to e6}
38.Qf2 {Waiting move}
38...Ne6 {As planned the Knight is in the central file now}
39.Bc1 {The Bishop will now in all probability go to the a3 square}
39...Ka7 {Another waiting move!}
40.Nc6+ {An inferior move that sparks a series of exchanges. Better was 40.f4 followed by Ba3 with pressure on the dark diagonal.}
40...Bxc6 {Black is happy to simplify and go into a superior endgame}
41.Rxe6 Re8 {Attacking the White Rook head on and offering another trade of Rooks this time}
42.Bg5 {The Bishop's position is improved}
42...Rxe6 43.Rxe6 Re8* {Offering to trade further}

1.e4 {The King's pawn opening.Perhaps the oldest opening move in the history of chess}
1...e6 {The French defense.Black prepares ...d5 and tends to play on light-squares.The drawback with this move is that Black's
Queen Bishop on c8 finds difficulties to develop}
2.d4 {White accepts the offer of placing both the central pawns on best squares}
2...d5 {Black plays ...d5 and hopes to have an equal stake in central control}
3.exd5 {The exchange variation.It is claimed to be drawish but Black can induce difficulties for White.Black's aim of playing ...d5 is to provoke the
pawn move e5 which fixes the pawns in the centre.Black would then get on with the job of undermining the centre with ...c5 or ...f6 before White consolidates.
Popular moves for White are 3.e5 which is the advanced variation.3.Nd2 gives rise to the Tarrasch variation while 3.Nc3 is the classical variation.In the game
White treads a different path altogether}
3...exd5 {Black's Bishop on c8 has a freed diagonal and can move to g4 or f5 easily.White's decision has given up his space advantage and unleashed the Black's Queen Bishop on c8}
4.Nf3 {A good move that places the Knight on an optimal square.A better move is perhaps 3.Bd3 that keeps the option of playing Ne2.
Black can play ...Bg4 to pin the Knight on f3 now}
4...Nc6 {This Knight move introduces an imbalance.Black pressurises the pawn on d4 square and takes the first step towards castle Queenside}
5.Bd3 {White intends to castle on the Kingside.5.Bb5 was perhaps better - a Ruy Lopez like move}
5...Bd6 {Black too develops on a solid square and keeps the e7 square vacant for the King's Kinight on g8}
6.O-O {White completes his Kingside development}
6...Nge7 {Black too develops the King's Knight and controls the f5 square. Ideas like ...Bg4 or ...Bf5 followed by ...Qd7 and O-O-O
are on the cards}
7.c3 {White aims for a solid setup where the d4 pawn is overprotected against moves like ...Bg4.7.c4!? would have been more pro-active}
7...Bf5 {Black continues with his development and is interested to swap the light-squared Bishops}
8.Bxf5 Nxf5 {Black succeeds in exchanging the light-squared Bishop}
9.Re1+{Which checks and improves the position of the Rook}
9...Nfe7 {Covers the check}
10.Qb3 {Attacking the b7 pawn.}
10...Na5 {Black not only saves the pawn but also attacks the Queen}
11.Qb5+{White does not gain anything as thge Black Knight is safe}
11...c6 {Preventing the Knight from the Queen and also blocking the check}
12.Qd3 {The Queen jumps to a safe square}
12...O-O {Black castles and completes the development}
13.b3 {White wants to push c4.Perhaps a better move was 13.Nbd2 that would have allowed c4 later.Another probable move from White seems to be Ba3 and exchange the Bishops.}
13...Re8 {The Black Rook is now on the open e-file}
14.Ba3 {Offering the exchange of the remaining Bishops. Good idea}
14...Bxa3 {14...Bc7 preventing the exchange of Bishops runs into 15.Nd2 and White still has the idea of pushing c4 to gain space}
15.Nxa3 b6 {Black makes room for the Knight to jump to b7}
16.Nc2 {Improving the position of the Knight}
16...Nb7 {Black too follows suit and improves the Knight's position}
17.Re2 {Intending to double the Rooks on the e-file. Good principled chess}
17...Nd6 {Improving the position of the Knight further}
18.Rae1 {White follows up with his plan.}
18...Qd7 {Connecting the Rooks.It looks like White will exchange more pieces once the Knight on e7 moves}
19.c4 {Good Move.White wants to open up lines by playing this space-gaining move}
19...Ng6{A quiet move offering to trade Rooks}
20.Ne5 {Attacking the Queen}
20...dxc4 {Attacking the Queen in return.20...Qc7 is also okay for Black.}
21.bxc4 {White strengthens his central squares instead}
21...Qc7{Black Queen goes on a harmless square}
22.c5 {Attacking the Knight as it has no good squares to jump to}
22...bxc5 23.dxc5  {White exchanges the pawn and now White and Black have similar pawn structures}
23...Nb7 {Attacking the c5 pawn}
24.Qc3 {Defending the pawn}
24...Rad8 {Activating the last piece}
25.g3 {Preventing ...Nf4}
25...Rd5 {Attacking the pawn on c5}

26...Rxe2 27.Rxe2 Qd7 {Attacking the Knight on d3}
28.Ncb4 {Attacking the Rook}
28...Rf5 {The Rook is safe here without losing control of the fifth rank}
29.Re4 {The Rook is centralised}
29...a5 {The Knight is kicked away}
30.Nc2 {The only square with safety.30.Na6 looks innocuous}
30...Rd5 {Attacking the other Knight now}
31.Rd4 {Ready to trade Rooks}
31...Nd8 {The Knight will pressurise the c5 pawn from e6 but the position is looking drab and drawish}
32.Rxd5 Qxd5 {White trades the Rooks}
33.Qd4 {White offers the Queen trade also}
33...Ne7 {Black defends the pawn as 33...Qxd4 34.Nxd4 allows White to push f4 and f5 at will. Also in that case,
the Knight on d8 has to keep an eye on the backward c6 pawn as White's Knight occupies an excellent outpost on d4}
34.Nf4 {Attacking the Queen and forcing an exchange of Queens}
34...Qxd4 35.Nxd4
35...g5 {Kicking the Knight away and vacating the g7 square for the King}
36.Nd3 Kg7 37.Kg2 {A draw is offered which Black accepts}1/2-1/2

1.e4 {The King's pawn opening}
1...e6 {The French defense}
2.d4 {White puts both the central pawns on ideal squares}
2...d5 {Black attacks the e4 pawn and threatens to dislodge it}
3.Nd2 {The Tarrasch variation where White supports the e4 pawn but blocks the dark-squared Bishop.
3.Nb3 is the Classical variation that is considered to be the strongest reply
while 3.e5 is another alternative known as the advanced variation}
3...Be7!? {The Morozevich variation or the Romanishin variation where Black waits for White to make a move.This move leads to double-edged battles as many games suggest}
4.Ngf3 {The most natural looking move}
4...Nf6 {Black aims to provoke White from pushing e5}
5.e5 {White closes the centre by attacking the Knight}
5...Nfd7{Black's aims is to play ...c5 at some point and then attack White's pawn formation - a regular theme in such variations of the French defence}
6.Bd3 {The best continuation for White when rapid development is an idea followed by a Kingside assault}
6...c5 {Black's idea is to attack White's pawn chain in the centre and get a Queenside initiative going}
7.c3 {White supports the d4 pawn as ...c4 looms from Black}
7...b6 {White's good Bishop on a3 will now be under radar of Black's Bishop on c8 after ...Ba6.White's Bishop has no place to hide.
Black's idea is to exchange his light-squared Bishop which is always a problem piece in these French defence setups with White's good Bishop
Black's other move that is mostly played is 7...Nc6 that exerts more pressure on the d4 pawn.If Black succeds with the exchange of Bishops then the White Knight on f3
gets stuck.}
8.Qe2!? {Interesting move to disallow Black from playing ...Ba6}
8...a5 {The Rook on a8 now supports the ...Ba6 idea.Black is hell-bent on exchanging the light-squared Bishops}
9.Nf1 {White improves the position of the Knight.The light-squared Bishops will go off the board. A good idea as 9.O-O would mean that White
will have to play Re1 to vacate the f1 square for the Knight. Castling can wait in this closed position}
9...Ba6 {Black achieves his plan}
10.Bxa6 {Better to exchange as 10.Ng3 Bxd3 11.Qxd3 Nc6 allows Black's Knight to develop easily.Now the exchange of the Bishop on a6 means that Black will have to play an additional move
to improve the position of his Knight. Good thinking.}
10...Nxa6 {Black completes the exchange of the light-squared Bishops and the position is equal}
11.Ng3 {Clears the path for O-O and the Knight is now ready to jump into Black's position.}
11...Nab8 {Black too improves the position of the misplaced Knight and this Knight will go to the c6 square}
12.O-O {White castles and both the Knights are ready for action}
12...Nc6 {Black puts the Knight to a meaningful square and pressurises the pawn on d4}
13.Rd1!? {Nice attempt to open up the central files with c4 followed by cxd5 as the Black King is still in the centre}
13...O-O {Another move that Black can play is 13...Qc8 with the idea of Qa6 or Qb7.Black can look for a Queenside expansion
but 14.c4 seems to solve White's problems. 14...dxc4 15.d5!? exd5 16.Rxd5 and followed by moves like Qxc4, White is better.
It would be annoying for Black if White can then play moves like Qg4,Nh5 putting pressure on the g-file. The move ...Qc8 is loaded with risks that can backfire if White manages to
open up the d-file for his Rooks}
14.Nh5 {White does not opt for the c4 idea but instead plays a move to provoke a pawn push from Black.White is eyeing the g7 square and the ideas to out more pressure on the g7 pawn are Qe3-f4-g3.}
14...Qc8!? {Interesting move. Black's Queen is eyeing the b7 or the a6 square.With ...Qb7 Black is aiming for b5-c4-a4 pawn push that will allow Black to expand on the Queenside while ...Qa6 comes with the idea of trading Queens followed by the same c4-a4-b5 pawn push motif
Another important observation is that Black stops White from the immediate 15.c4 because 15...dxc4 16.Qxc4 cxd4 17.Nxd4 Nxe5 wins a pawn for Black and breaking White's central hold
Also 15.c4 dxc4 16.d5 exd5 17.Rxd5 b5! is also good for Black. 14...Qc7 also was good to prevent the c4 pawn push but then the Queen is cut-off from the Rooks and the defence of the f7 pawn if required.White's attack at the moment is yet to start and it is good to mix caution with aggression}
15.Ng5 {The Knights are provoking Black to push one of the pawns and attack the Knight.Which pawn push could lead White to an advantage is the question that remains to be answered.Another possibility that Black needs to look at is the move Qg4
that brings White's principal attacking piece to an important square}
15...g6 {15...h6?? 16.Nh3 threatening Qg4 followed by Qg7# 1536...Kh7 vacating the g8 square for the Rook 17.Nxg7! and White has a crushing attack}
16.Ng3 {White retreats the Knight.Interesting choice would hav}
16...h6 {Attacking the other Knight now and forcing White to go back}
17.Nh3 {The White Knight goes back to a passive square and keeps the option open for Qg4.Another interesting idea
was 17.Nxe6 fxe6 18.Bxh6 Rf7 19.Qg4 Ndxe5 protecting the g6 pawn
and also offering the piece back.20.dxe5 Nxe5 21.Qe2 Nc6 and the game is equal with
White having some chances against the wafer-thin pawn structure in front of the Black King.White's aggression with the Knights look absurd now}
17...Kg7 {Protecting the attacked pawn on h6 and also vacating the g8 and h8 squares for the Rook to come in for defence}
18.Qg4 {The Queen joins her Knights}
18...Rg8 {Black's Rook aims to defend the g-file.18...Rh8 is also possible but the h6 pawn can always be protected by ...Rh8 if required.White's Knights are an impediment for h4 and g4 pawn pushing ideas and hence Black can afford to wait.
Another White move Nh5+ is also diluted as the Rook will be X-raying the White Queen from g8}
19.a4 {Preventing ...b5}
19...Kh7 {A quiet move that intends to bring the Bishop or Queen to f8 to protect the pawn on h6}
20.Nf4{Vacating the h-file with ideas like h4 or Qh3 on the cards}
20...Bf8 {Beefing up the security of the King.Protecting the h6 pawn and preparing moves like ...Rb8, ...b5}
21.h4 {White expands on the Kingside hoping to breakthrough but unfortunately the Knights are blocking the g and f-pawns which ensures that the attack is slow}
21...Qe8 {Adding more strength to the e8-h5 diagonal and also overprotecting the e6 pawn as Nxe6 is a threat to damage the pawn structure}
22.b3 {White waits}
22...Rb8 {Preparing a Queenside expansion with ...b5}
23.Be3 {Developing the Bishop and pressurising the pawn on c5.Although dxc5 is not possible on the next move due to ...Nxe5}
23...b5 {Black continues with his idea}
24.axb5 Rxb5 {The pawn on b3 is attacked as White's pieces are still attempting an assault on the Black King}
25.Rdb1 {Nice move supporting the pawn on b3.The d1 and e2 squares are kept ready for the Queen to come back as White's attack on the
Kingside looks dead}
25...Bg7 {The Bishop makes way for the Rook to swing into action and occupies a defensive square}
26.Qd1 {The Queen comes back to add further protection to the pawn on b3.White's attack has come to an end}
26...Qb8 {Increasing the pressure on the b3 pawn and keeping White tied for the moment}
27.Nd3 {The Knight too jumps back and pressurises the c5 pawn.White is improving the position of his pieces and trying to
get some activity in the centre and the Queenside}
27...Qb7 {Ideas like ...Rb8 or ...Rc8 are on the cards depending upon White's response}
28.h5 {White wants Black to accept the pawn and open up the position}
28...g5 {28...gxh5? 29.Nxh5 Kh8 30.Nxg7 Rxg7 31.Bxh6 and White's position will start falling apart}
29.Nf1 {The Knight will be re-maneouvered to d2 to support the pawn on b3 in case Black presses with ...Rb8}
29...Rb8 {Black adds more pressure on the b3 pawn}
30.Nd2 {White supports the b3 pawn one more time}
30...Kg8 {A waiting move}
31.Rc1 {White moves the Rook and looks to push c4 at some point. Since the Knight is defending the b3 pawn,Black's battery of heavy pieces cannot capture the pawn on b3 as this would lead to the loss of an exchange}
31...Qa6 { X-raying the Knight on d3.Black attempts to create counterplay}
32.Qf1 {Protecting the Knight in advance}
32...R5b7 {The Queen is now eyeing the Knight}
33.g3 {With no threats from Black, White prepares to push f4 and open up the Kingside}
33...Rf8 {The Rook comes back to the Kingside for a potential skirmish}
34.Kg2 {White waits and does not commit f2-f4 pawn break}
34...Rbb8 {Black too does not commit anything. Another waiting move}
35.f4 {White goes for the pawn break looking to open up the game}
35...gxf4 36.Nxf4 Qxf1+ 37.Rxf1 Rfc8 {Black goes for simplification and also offers a draw.Draw is agreed}1/2-1/2
