1.e4 e6 {The French defence}
2.d4 d5 {White grabs the centre with his pawns and Black counters it with the pawn on d5.Black's Bishop on c8 is a problem piece in this setup}
3.e5 {Grabbing more space and willing to attack on the Kingside later}
3...c5 {Thematic move in this setup as Black pressurises the pawn on d4. Black will do everything possible to break the central pawn complex}
4.c3 {The pawn on d4 is offered more support}
4...Nc6 {Developing a piece and maintaining the pressure on the d4 pawn}
5.Nf3 Qb6 {Both players are doing their bit to attack and defend the d4 square}
6.a3!? {A nice move that aims to push b4 and gain space on the Queenside}
6...Nge7 {A flexible move that aims to play ...Nf5 and put even more pressure on the d4 square.Another move is ...Nh6 but
White can double Black's pawns with Bxh6 gxh6}

12...O-O {Castling is safe here}
13.b4 {Gains more space on the Queenside}

15.Nd2 {Nice developing move as all pieces need to join the party}

1.d4 Nf6
2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 d5 {Transposing to the QGD or Queen's Gambit Declined}
4.Nf3 Bb4 {The Ragozin variation of the QGD}
5.Bg5 {The dark-squared Bishop pins the Knight.}
5...O-O {Black chooses to complete the development of the Kingside}
6.e3 {The dark-squared Bishop is outside the pawn chain }
6...Nbd7 {Nice move.Another active move would have been 6...c5}
7.cxd5 {White could have played 7.Be2 But then 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 would have meant a loss of tempo for White.White intends to develop the
Bishop on d3}
7...exd5 8.Bd3 {Now White can castle short}
8...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}
9.Bh4 {The pin is maintained}
9...c6 {9...c5 was a more proactive option staking a claim to the d4 square}
10.O-O {Development of the Rook on h1 }
10...Qb6 {Not sure about the plan but ...Be7 looked much better as the Bishop on b4 is not doing anything as White has now castled}

12.a3 {Putting the question to the Bishop}
12...Bd6 {The trading of Bishop for the Knight is not wise}
13.Rae1 {White wants to push e4 soon}
13...c5?! {Does not seem to be a pleasant move at first instinct The pawn on d5 loses support. Black is yet to solve the problem of his Queenside.The Bishop on c8 and the Rook on a8 are
mere spectators.13...Rb8 is a playable option. Black can also opt for a plan to strengthen the Kingside with moves like ...Kh8,...Ng8 followed by ...Ndf6,...Bd7
The Queen can them come back to c7 and the Bishop on d6 together can look for some Kingside action. 13...Qc7 followed by ...b6 also seems to be okay for Black.}
14.Na4! {Immediately attacking the pawn on c5 and the Queen on b6.This move does not allow Black to push ...c4 to close the position but forces him to take evasive action}
14...Qc7 {The Queen-Bishop now form an excellent battery on the b8-h2 diagonal but White now exploits the fact that the Knight on d7 is doing two protective tasks - supporting the comrade on f6
and also giving additional protection to the pawn on c5}
15.Bxf6 {Assuming Black captures with the Knight on d7 to protect the defragmentation of the pawns, the pawn on c5 loses a vital support}
15...Nxf6 {Black captures with the Knight but leaves the pawn on c5 without adBd7*equate support}
16.dxc5 {White wins a pawn}
16...Bf8 {Saving the Bishop. ...Be7 would have blocked the Rook's eye on e8}

in return for a pawn deficit}

It is unclear as to how Black will do the same.
21...a5 was a good option trying to open up the a-file after ...axb4}

22...Rcd8 {Getting out of the Bishop's sight}
23.f4 {Attacking the Queen and most importantly gaining control of the e5 square}
23...Qe7?! {Better was 23...Qb8 adding protection to the a7 pawn}

2.d4 g6 3.c4 Bg7 {Transposing to the King's Indian defence}
4.Nc3 O-O {The King's Indian defence is up.Here Black has developed rapidly.The pawn on d6 controls the e5 square while the Bishop on g7 controls the a1-h8 diagonal}
5.g3 {Fianchetto of the Bishop to g2 is a common idea}
5...d6 {Black controls the e5 square.Another pragmatic approach would have been 5...d5 freeing the game for Black}

6...Nbd7 {Intending to push ...e5}
7.e4 {White forms a strong centre - a common idea in the KID}

8.O-O {White completes his development of the Kingside}
8...e5 {Black stakes his claim in the centre}
9.dxe5 {White gives up the centre allowing Black an easier game. 9.b3 or 9.Be3 are the candidate moves that come to mind}
9...Nxe5 {9...dxe5 is also okay for Black.Offering an exchange of Knights eases the cramp in Black's game}
10.Nxe5 dxe5
11.Bg5 Be6 {Development with a threat of capturing the pawn on c4}
12.b3 Qe7 {Preparing ...Rad8}

20.Ne2 {Opening up the attack on the e5 pawn}
20...Nd7 {The threat is neutralised}
21.f4 {The e5 pawn is attacked again}
21...Bg7* {The Bishop goes back and protects the pawn on e5}
22.a3? {A waiting move gone wrong.White's dark squares on the g1-f2-e3-d4 squares have been weakened by the move f4 earlier. The next Black move
exploits this loophole. A better waiting move was 22.h3 preventing ...Bg4. 22.Bf3 was also good enough to prevent ...Bg4 that would pin the Knight on e2}
22...Qc5+!* {A nice check allowing Black's Queen to dominate the dark squares around the White King. Black is now threatening to play ...Qe3 and ...Bg4 to attack the Knight on e2 twice}

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defence is a solid foundation for many other branches of Black's defences}
2.c4 g6 {The King's Indian defence or KID is a sharp and combative defence}

3...c5!? {Putting the question to the d4 pawn immediately}
4.d5 {Gaining more space in the centre}
4...d6 {Black could have also played 4...e6 or 4...Bg7 with an intention to complete development}
5.e4 {White forms a strong central light-square pawn chain complex}
5...Bg7 6.Ne2 {The Knight cannot go to the f3 square.Hence it will try to go to c3 if White decides to pursue a Queenside expansion.This
Knight can also go to the f4 or g3 square in case of a fight on the Kingside}

7.cxb5 {White accepts the gambit}
7...a6!? {More offerings from Black.}

5.e5 {The defender of the h5 square is threatened}

2.d4 d5 {White is happy to grab the centre with his dual pawns while Black unleashes the Queen pawn and controls the e4 and c4 squares}
3.exd5 exd5 {A lame option from White as dilution of the centre gives an easy game for Black. Before this capture Black's Queen Bishop on c8 had an uncertain future
but now Black can easily bring out the Bishop on c8 to f5 or the g4 squares.The exchange variation of the French is considered feeble for White}
4.Bd3 Nc6 {Putting pressure on the d4 pawn}
5.Ne2 {White defends the pawn. White deterred from playing 5.Nf3 as 5...Bg4 would have been an annoying pin}

18.Qe3 {A better move in my opinion was to play 18.b3 and then push c4 later.White needs to strive for some activity}
18...Ne6 {The repositioning of the Knight is complete as the battle on the Kingside will heat up}
19.f3?! {Looks unsound to me. The g3 square is weakened.Better option was 19.b3 to prepare the c4 pawn break}
19...Qh4 {Black latches onto the opportunity by attacking the h2 pawn and forcing White on the defensive}
20.Qg1 {Better option in my opinion is 20.Nf1 The Queen gets into a tangle just to save a pawn}
20...Nf4 {Keeping an eye on the g2 pawn and impairing the Queen's movement further}
21.Kd1 {21.b3 again could have been considered instead of the move played}

1.f4 {The risky Bird's opening}
1...e5!? {From's Gambit. A typical anti-Bird opening move where Black is ready to deliver the knockout punch. By pushing f4 White has weakened the
e1-h4 diagonal.}
2.e4 {Transposing into the King's Gambit!}
2...exf4 {Accepting the Gambit is the best possible alternative for Black. 2...d5 is also another option known as the Falkbeer Countergambit}
3.Bc4 {3.Nf3 is considered to be the best continuation here}
3...Nc6 {Black keeps his options open on the Kingside. This flexible looking move also develops a piece}
4.Nf3 {The Knight develops and White prepares to O-O}

8...Na5 {The attacked Knight in turn attacks the Bishop on c4}
9.Nfd2 {Both threats are now resolved}
9...Nxc4 10.Nxc4 {Black eliminates the Bishop pair.The Bishop on c4 was annoying as it constantly threatened Bxf7 at some point in the future}
10...b5 {Attacking the Knight again}
11.Nca3 {The Knight on the rim is dim - a popular chess saying. White could have played 11.Qxg4 and attack the Bishop on g7
instead.11...Qg5 12.Qf3 bxc4 13.Bxf4 and an unclear position where Black seems to enjoy a slight advantage}
11...f3 {Black is willing to sacrifice the b5 pawn for activity as the pawn on f3 can turn out to be a real nemesis for White}
12.Nxb5 {White accepts the pawn sacrifice and now WHite threatens to push d6 which will be really uncomfortable for Black}
12...d6 {Black prevents White from gaining space}
13.Qd3 {Another good move was 13.Be3}
13...h5 {Creating a strong pawn chain complex on the light squares h5-g4-f3}
14.Qc4 {Threatening Nxc7+ and winning the Rook on a8}
14...Rb8 {The threat is parried.Will White grab another pawn or develop pieces?}
15.Bf4{White develops pieces and is the right thing to do.}
15...Ne7 {Can Black turn greedy and play 15...Bxb2? 16.N1a3 Bxa1 17.Rxa1 Nf6 and Black is slightly better}
16.N1c3 {White resigns without any reason}0-1

5.Qb3 {White parries the threat by attacking the b7 pawn and the d5 pawn for the third time.}

10...h5?! {A wild looking move. Black attacks White's pawn on g4 and aims to open up the game.}
11.Nxd5 {White eliminates the control over the f4 square by swapping Knights. Now the Knight on e2 will come to f4 and harass the Bishop again}
11...cxd5 12.Nf4 hxg4 {Black wants to play sharp chess and opens up the h-file.12...Nc6 seems much better.}
13.Nxg6 fxg6 {Black pawns are in tatters}
14.e4 {The pawn on d5 is attacked and White threatens to win back the pawn on d5}
14...gxh3? {Black makes the cardinal mistake of opening up flanks and lines with the King still in the centre}

21...Qe7 22.Qxg6+ {Black resigned as 22...Qf7 23.Qxf7# is inevitable}1-0

upper-hand}
5...O-O {Black will complete development before posing a challenge to White's pawn structure}

1.e4 e6
2.f4?! {Not the main option as it weakens the Kingside.Better would have been 2.d4.This is the La Bourdonnais Variation}
2...d5
3.e5 c5
4.Nf3 Nc6
5.c3 Qb6 { Another good move was 5...Nh6
as Black could have taken the opportunity to develop the Knight on g8 as White's dark-squared Bishop is still undeveloped on c1.
White's problem piece in the advanced variation of the French defence will be the Queen's Bishop.The Queen move played in the game keeps an eye on the b2 square.Another
important duty served by the Queen is to control the d4 square}
6.Na3 {Nice move. The Knight will go to c2 and control the d4 square}
6...Nh6 {Black's Knight will go to d5 and exert pressure on the d4 square. The battle for the d4 squares is in full swing - an important theme in the advanced variation of the French defence}
7.h3?! {Unsure about White's intentions. This move,I presume, prepares the g4 advance.Better was 7.Nc2.The g3 square now is permanently weak and Black must do something to exploit it}
7...Nf5 {The Knight too joins the party in controlling the d4 square. This move also prevents g4 for the moment as the Knight can jump to g3}

10.d4 Be7 {Black continues to build a nice game}
11.Bd3 {White too aims to bring out his pieces}
11...f6!? {11...O-O was also a good option. But Black opts for an aggressive setup trying to challenge White's poawn chain complex on the dark squares}
12.Be3 {12.Kf2 kicking away the Knight seems a better option. The move played leaves the b2 pawn hanging}
