1.d4 Nf6 {The Queen's pawn opening is answered by the flexible Knight move controlling the e4 square. Here Black does not commit his pawn structure and has a
variety of options to choose from. }

2.c4 {The best move as White controls the d5 square and gains space. The Knight on b1 can now go to c3 and control the e4 and d5 squares}

2...e6 {The move controls the d5 square and opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop on f8.Black can also play ...d5 and stake a claim to the central
e4 and c4 squares}

3.Nc3 {White develops the Queen's Knight to the best square and adds more control over the e4 and d5 squares. White wants to push e4 soon and have a massive centre.}

3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence named after its creator Aron Nimzowitsch, a leading Danish-Russian chess master who was a pioneer of the hypermodern chess theory.
The Knight on c3 is pinned and has no control over the e4 and d5 squares. Here Black develops a piece and is looking to castle on the next move. In most cases, the Bishop
on b4 will be exchanged for the Knight after ...Bxc3. Black hopes to strike at the centre later owing to his much more active development.}

4.e3* {The Rubinstein variation named after Akiba Rubinstein a well-known Polish Grandmaster. Rubinstein encyclopedic knowledge of chess endgames is legendary.
Here White neglects the threat of ...Bxc3+ and proceeds to activate the Bishop on f1. White wants to
develop soon and later on carry on a positional struggle in the centre. The downside of this move is that the
Bishop on c1 gets locked-in and White will have to do extra to activate it.}

1.e4 {White's pawn opening is considered to be the best and has been the oldest opening move in recorded chess history}

1...e6  {The French defence where Black will challenge the centre with ...d5}

2.d4 d5* {White occupies the central squares while Black hits back with the control of the c4 and e4 squares.Black has created a light-square pawn complex but the
downside is that the Bishop on c8 may take time to activate}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation in which White reinforces his support to the e4 pawn by developing the Queen's Knight. 3.e5 leads to the advanced variation while
3.Nd2 is called the Tarassch variation}

3...Bb4* {The Winawer variation where the Bishop on b4 pins the Knight and threatens to capture ...dxe4 and win a central pawn}
