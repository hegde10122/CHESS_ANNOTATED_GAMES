1.d4 Nf6 {The Queen's pawn opening is answered by the flexible Knight move controlling the e4 square. Here Black does not commit his pawn structure and has a
variety of options to choose from. }

2.c4 {The best move as White controls the d5 square and gains space. The Knight on b1 can now go to c3 and control the e4 and d5 squares}

2...e6 {The move controls the d5 square and opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop on f8.Black can also play ...d5 and stake a claim to the central
e4 and c4 squares}

3.Nc3 {White develops the Queen's Knight to the best square and adds more control over the e4 and d5 squares. White wants to push e4 soon and have a massive centre.}

3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence named after its creator Aron Nimzowitsch, a leading Danish-Russian chess master who was a pioneer of the hypermodern chess theory.
The Knight on c3 is pinned and has no control over the e4 and d5 squares. Here Black develops a piece and is looking to castle on the next move. In most cases, the Bishop
on b4 will be exchanged for the Knight after ...Bxc3. Black hopes to strike at the centre later owing to his much more active development.}

4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation named after Akiba Rubinstein, a well-known Polish Grandmaster. Rubinstein's encyclopedic knowledge of chess endgames is legendary.
Here White neglects the threat of ...Bxc3+ and proceeds to activate the Bishop on f1. White wants to
develop soon and later on carry on a positional struggle in the centre. The downside of this move is that the
Bishop on c1 gets locked-in and White will have to do extra to activate it.}

4...b6 {A great choice from Black where he is looking to fianchetto the light-squared bishop to b7. Another annoying move is to play ...Ba6 and attack the pawn on c4 if White were to slip up
4...c5 or 4...d5 are the other common choices.This move introduces the Fischer variation in the Nimzo-indian}

5.Bd3 {White gets on with the development of the Kingside - a key motif in this variation of the Nimzo-Indian}

5...Bb7 {5...O-O is also an alternative for Black}

6.Nf3 O-O {Development for both the parties}

7.O-O c5 {All standard theory in this variation so far. Black is now challenging White's central control.Black stops White from pushing e4 as of now}

8.Na4 {White now aims to get Black's Bishop to move to a5 where it's value will be decreased.White wants to play 9.dxc5 and get the Bishop after Black recaptures ...Bxc5}

8...cxd4 {Black clears the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop as he anticipates White's pawn push a3 anytime soon}

9.a3 {White does not recapture the pawn but attacks the Bishop}

9...Bd6 {9...Be7 is the move preferred by many masters which I feel is better than the move played by Black in the game. The Bishop on d6 blocks the pawn advance d7-d6 or d7-d5 which will be Black's aim to get hold in the centre}

10.exd4 {10.Nxd4 is a passive recapture that allows Black to play 10...Nc6 11.b4 Ne5 12.Be2 Re8 and Black has more pressure on the c4 pawn}

10...Bxf3 {Black gives up the Bishop pair and aims to play in the centre}

11.Qxf3 Nc6 {The Rook on a8 was attacked and this move not only attacks the pawn on d4 but also blocks the Queen's vigil from f3}

12.Be3 {Protecting the pawn on d4.The position is equal}

12...e5 {This pawn push was the idea behind 9...Bd6. The d4 pawn is attacked again6gb  leaqding to sharp play}

13.dxe5 Nxe5 {Attacking the Queen}
14.Qd1 {The Queen goes back to the starting square}

14...Nxd3 {Black snatches the Bishop and goes for simplification}

15.Qxd3 {Attacking the Bishop on d6}

15...Qc7 {The Queen-Bishop battery is now eyeing the pawn on h2 and threatening ...Bxh2+}

16.h3 {16.g3 is also okay}

16...Rfe8 {Rook belongs to the semi-open file}

17.Rad1 {The Queen-Rook battery now attack the Bishop on d6 }

17...Re6 {Protects the Bishop and willing to play ...Rae8 to increase the influence on the e-file}

18.Nc3 {Intending to play Nb5 next forking the Bishop and the Queen}

18...Rae8?! {Doubling the Rooks on the e-file but how come Black did not see the fork coming on b5?}

19.Nb5 {The Bishop on d6 is attacked for the third time. What can Black do to save it?}

19...Bh2+ {Forced. The only safe square for the Bishop which also forces White's King to move}

20.Kh1 Qb8 {Forced moves for both sides}

21.Nd4 {21. Nxa7 looks juicy at the outset but Black has an excellent move that gets back the lost pawn with an equal position. 21...Be5! 22.Nb5 is forced.
22...Bxb2 and Black is perfectly alright here.}

21...Re4 {21...R6e7? is bad on account of 22.Nf5! attacking the Rook again.
More importantly the Knight guards the Bishop on e3 and is ready to push g3 trapping the Bishop on h2
Now Black will end up in a bad position after 22...Re5? 23.Bd4 23...Re6 24.g3 wiinning a piece.
22...Re6 is also a bad move as 23.g3 traps the Bishop on h2. 23...g6? 24.Nh6+ and White will gobble up the Bishop on the next move}

22.Nf5
{The Knight controls the g3 square and White threatens to trap the Bishop on h2.
Another alternative is to vacate the third rank for the White Queen by playing 22.Bg5 and also threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6.
Now White has multiple threats. By controlling the g3 square White, wants to play g3 and trap the Bishop on h2. The Knight on f6 also does not have an
escape square. 22...Nh5?? 23.Qf3! attacking the Knight 23...Nf6 24.g3 traps the Bishop on h2. Also, Qxd7 will be possible after White eliminates the Knight on f6}

22...Bc7 {Forced. 22...Be5 looks a good option at the outset attacking the pawn on b2 but this runs into trouble as 23.f3 Rxe3 24.Nxe3 Bxb2 and White is better}

23.Bg5 {White wants to eliminat the defender of the d7 pawn and gobble up the pawn later}

23...Qd8 {The Queen defends the pawn on d7 with a self-inflicted pin. }

24.Qf3 {The Rook on d1 again threatens Rxd7 taking advantage of the pinned Knight on f6 after Bxf6. Now Black will have to capture ...gxf6 to save the pawn on d7
Also a nice trap has been set for Black. 24...Rxc4? 25.Nh6+ 25...gxh6? 26.Bxf6 and Black's pawn structure is in tatters}

24....Bb8 {Black is non-commital 24...R4e6 was perhaps better to support the Knight on f6}

25.b3 {White removes the dangling carrot on c4 and forces Black to make a choice}

25...Qc7 {Threatening ...Qh2# on the next move}

26.g3 {26.Nd6? looks great but is actually terrible as Black defends everything. 26...R4e6 threatening 27...Rxd6. 27.Bf4 protecting the Knight
27...Rf8 and suddenly Black looks alright. 26.Qg3 is also bad as Black will happily trade Queens. 26...Qxg3 27.fxg3 R4e6 28.Bxf6 Rxf6 29.Rxd7 g6
30.Nh6+ Kg7 31.Rxf6 Kxf6 and Black will play ..Rd3 at some point and White'e extra pawn may not be significant}

26...Qe5 {Protecting the Knight on f6 as Black is willing to sacrifice the pawn on d7 for some activity. 26...Qc6 was better as Black could have threatened ...Rxc4 taking advantage
of the pinned Queen on f3}

27.Nh6+ {Time for some tactics as White wants to inflict some structural damage}

27...gxh6  {Black accepts the Knight and damages his pawn structure. 27...Kf8 28.Bxf6 Qxf6 29.Qxf6 gxf6 30.Rxd7 and White goes into a superior ending}

28.Bxf6 Qe6  {Attacking the pawn on h3}

29.Kg2 {Safety first}

29...Kf8 {The King wants to flee the g-file}

30.Rd5 {The White Rooks will now try to hunt down the pawn on d7 as White prepares Rfd1}

30...Qc6 {The e6 square is vacated for the Rook on e4 to re-enter the game as Black has almost given up on the d7 pawn}

31.Rfd1 {Doubling Rooks on the semi-open d-file and threatening to win the d7 pawn}

31...R4e6 {TheRook comes back into the game and threatens the Bishop on f6 which controls the vital e7 and d8 squares}

32.Bc3 {The Bishop is ready for Bb4+ on the next move}

32...Rg6 {Black sets a nice trap and lures White to take the d7 pawn}

33.R1d3 {Protecting the Queen and renewing the threat on d7. 33.Rxd7?? Rxg3+!! 34.fxg3 --Forced as the White Queen is pinned
34...Re2+!! taking advantage of the pinned Queen again. 35.Kf1 Qxf3+! and Black wins}

33...d6 {Protecting the pawn but Black entombes the Bishop on b8. A better move was 33...a5 to prevent Bb4+ 33...Re7 was also a better try}

34.h4 {White improves the pawn structure and waits. The Rook on d5 makes the life of the Black Queen difficult while the Rook on e8 is also not
contributing much.The Bishop on b8 is a tall pawn for now}

34...Bc7 {Another waiting move from the moribund Bishop}

35.h5 {White  expands on the Kingside and attacks the Rook}

35...Rge6 {The Rook goes back and White has a firm grip on the Kingside as Black's Queen and Bishop have become toothless}

36.Qg4 {The Queen is ready to deliver check on g7 followed by Qxh7 as Black looks crippled}

36...Ke7 {The King wants to escape to the Queenside}

37.Rf3 {Threatening Rxf7 if the King were to run away}

37...Rf8 {Black supports the f7 pawn with the Rook and the King is ready to escape}

38.Rdf5 {Adding more pressure on the f7 pawn, White wants to keep the Black King in the middle of the board}

38...Kd8 {Taking advantage of the pinned Rook on f3, the Black King can escape as the f5 pawn cannot be captured}

39.Kh2 {Threatening 40.Rxf7}

39...Re4 {Attacking the Queen on g4}

40.Qg7 {Turning the attention to the hapless pawns on h6 and h7, White wants Black to lose a tempo by saving the attacked Rook}

40...Rfe8 {The Rooks are connected}

41.Qxh6 {The mop-up operation has begun}
41...Kc8{The King runs away further from action}
42.Qxh7 {White creates a passed pawn on h5}
42...R4e7 {Adding more protection to the f7 pawn}
43.h6 {Passed pawn is meant to be pushed}
43...Bd8 {The Bishop is back }
44.Bf6 {Attacking the Rook}
44...Rd7 {The Rook gets away}
45.Bxd8 {Liquidation to come closer to the endgame}
45...f6 {Attacking the Queen}
46.Qg6 {Only square for the Queen}
46...Rdxd8 {Controlling the h8 square}
47.h7 {Passed pawn is meant to be pushed}
47...Kb8 {Waiting move}
48.Rxf6 Rh8 {Black is absolutely passive}
49.Re3 {Looking to penetrate the seventh rank as Black is completely paralysed}
49...a5 50.Rf7 {Black resigned as both the Rooks will infiltrate the seventh rank and grab even more pawns}1-0

1.e4 {White's pawn opening is considered to be the best and has been the oldest opening move in recorded chess history}

1...e6  {The French defence where Black will challenge the centre with ...d5}

2.d4 d5 {White occupies the central squares while Black hits back with the control of the c4 and e4 squares.Black has created a light-square pawn complex but the
downside is that the Bishop on c8 may take time to activate}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation in which White reinforces his support to the e4 pawn by developing the Queen's Knight. 3.e5 leads to the advanced variation while
3.Nd2 is called the Tarassch variation}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation where the Bishop on b4 pins the Knight and threatens to capture ...dxe4 and win a central pawn}

4.e5 {The most popular response in accordance with standard theory. White fixes the dark-pawn chain complex in the centre and grabs more space}

4...c5 {Black too aims to have his share of pawns in the centre. Black attacks White central d-pawn with his flank pawn push ...c5}

5.a3 Bxc3+ {Black gives up the Bishop pair}

6.bxc3 Qa5!?  {The Portisch-Hook variation as it is called.Black's Queen attacks the pawn on c3 and prevents White from developing quickly}

7.Bd2 Qa4 {The Queen now attacks the pawn on d4. More importantly, the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn. White's Qg4 is a common idea in these Winawer variations. The Black Queen can afford to make another move as these nuances will make White think hard.}

8.Qg4!? {The White Queen also plays along and attacks the pawn on g7. The pawn on c2 is kept hanging.}

8...g6 {The dark-squares f6 and h6 are weakened by this move but Black aims to stop White's counterplay.
8...Kf8!? is also a modern-day idea wherein the Black King protects the dark squares! Whith ...g6 Black has kept his options of playing O-O-O later intact.}

9.Nf3 {White persists with the gambit pawn on c2 and hopes to play Ng5,Qf4 and attack the pawn on f7. This makes sense as the Bishop on c8
is hindered and the Black Queen is sitting on a4}

9...h6 {9...Nc6 is the recommended move according to theory and practice. The idea here is to meet 10.Ng5 with 10...Nd8. White's goal is to infiltrate the Kingside with the Queen and the Knight.
Black deviates from theory and has snuffed out the Ng5 option. In the process Black is lagging behind in development.}

10.Bd3 {White perhaps should have tried 10.Be2 as the Bishop on d3 will have to go back as we shall see}

10...c4 {Black closes the centre and kicks the Bishop}

11.Be2 {11.Bxg6 fxg6 12.Qxg6+ Kf8 is okay for Black as White's Rooks are still on their home squares}

11...Nc6 {No more pawn moves!}

12.Ra2 {White could have continued his aggressive intentions by playing 12.O-O The Rook support to the pawn on c2 looks timid in
comparison.}

12...Bd7 {Black wants to play O-O-O next and neutralise White's Kingside aggression}

13.Qh4 {Another Queen move to prevent Black from castling long by controlling the d8 square! A better alternative is 13.O-O}

13...Nge7 {Blocking the d8 square from the Queen's glare and prepares O-O-O}

14.Ng5!? {Another active prophylactic move from White stopping Black from O-O-O 14...O-O-O ? 15.Nxf7 forking both the Black Rooks and winning the exchange}

14...Nf5 {Attacking the Queen and forcing her to go to a corner and waste another move.}

15.Qh3 {Forced. The Queen has to maintain the pin of the h6 pawn or else the Knight on g5 would fall}

15...Qa5 {The Queen move deters White from castling as 16.O-O? will allow Black to grab a pawn. 16...Ncxd4 17.bxc4 Qxd2}

16.Ra1 {White goes back with the Rook as the c2 pawn does not need protection}

16...Nce7 {Black plans to attack the c2 pawn again but this time with ...Ba4.Both sides cannot castle and this seems to be a logical plan}

17.g4 {White wants to bust open the g-file for an assault on the Black King}

17...Ng7 {Forced}

18.Rg1 {White gives up his castling rights and is still hopeful of an attack against the Black King. Rg1-g3-f3 seems to be the idea.
This is too slow though. 18.O-O was much better }

18...Qb6 { 18...Ba4 was the earlier plan but White always has the move 19.Rc1 to defend the pawn on c2.
White defensive Rook move has now given Black another idea to re-maneuver the Queen to b2 and then grab the pawn on a3}

19.Rg3 {White goes for the Rf3 followed by Rxf7 idea}

19...Qb2 {The whole point of ...Qb6. Attacking the pawns on a3,c2 and most importantly the Rook on a1. White must go on the defensive for a
brief while}

20.Rc1 {Defending the pawn on c2 as well}

20...Nc6 {Preparing ...Nd8 in case White decides to play Rf3 and attack the pawn on f7}

21.Rf3 {White goes for it}

21...Nd8 {The Knight is a great defender of the f7 pawn and Black has all the points covered}

22.Qh4 {Vacating the h3 square for the Knight or the Rook}

22...Ba4 {Cranking up the pressure on the c2 pawn}

23.Kd1 {The King is the new defender of the c2 pawn!}

23...Qxa3 {The Queen grabs a pawn and creates a passed pawn on the a-file}

24.Nh3 {Opening up an attack on the h6 pawn with the Bishop.}

24...h5 {The pawn is pushed down further}

25.Bg5 {The Bishop is back on an active diagonal}

25...Nc6 {26.Bf6 is not a huge problem for Black as 26...Na5 27.Bxg7? Nb3! 28.Qg5 Nxc1 is good for Black}

26.Bf6 {Pinning the Knight on g7.}

26...Na5!?  {26...Rg8?! is not better. 27.Bxg7 Rxg7 28.gxh5 gxh5 29.Qf6 Qf8 30.Ng5 and White turns the screws}

27.Bxg7 {White accepts the piece sacrifice}
27...Nb3 {Forced}
28.Qg5 {Protecting the Rook on c1}
28...Nxc1 {Black will trades Knight and the Queen}
29.Qxc1 Qxc1+ 30.Kxc1 Rh7 {Attacking the Bishop.}
31.gxh5 {Forced. 31.Bf6?? hxg4 with a fork on the White Rook and Knight}
31...Rxg7 {Black gets back the piece with a drawish position}
32.h6 {Attacking the Rook again. 32.hxg6?? Rxg6 and Black is an exchange up. 32.}
32...Rh7 {Black Rook goes away}
33.Ng5 {Attacking the f7 pawn}
33...Rxh6 {The Rook has no option but to given up on the f7 pawn}
34.Nxf7 {The Rook is attacked again as White has gone for a series of forced exchanges and brought the game closer to a draw}
34...Rh7 {Attacking the Knight again}
35.Ng5 Rxh2 {Another pawn grabbed}
36.Nxe6 Rc8 37.Nf4 Bc6 38.Nxg6 Kd8
39.Rf6 Kc7 {The King is safe on the Queenside}
40.Bg4 Rd8 {The Rook on c8 was under attack}

1.d4 Nf6  {The Indian defence}

2.Bg5 {The Trompowsky attack. Here White wants to damage Black's pawn structure after Bxf6 and carry out a blistering attack on the weakened Kingside}

2...c5 {A theoretical move. Black hits back in the centre and challenges the pawn on d4. Black is not afraid of the Knight capture and the damage to the pawn structure}

3.Bxf6 {White gives up the Bishop pair and goes ahead with the plan. 3.d5 or 3.Nc3 is also considered playable for White}

3...exf6 {Capturing away from the centre opens the e7 square for the Bishop and Black can still O-O activating the Rook on h8. 3...gxf6 is also playable. In that case
the g-file will be available for the Rook on g8 for active counterplay. But the downside is that Black's King might remain stuck in the centre or will have to O-O-O in order to be safe}

4.Nc3 {As White has already made his intentions clear to carry out an offensive against Black, quick development is necessary. }

4...d5 {Black occupies the central d5 square with his pawn and does not allow White to gain space by pushing the pawn on d4 to d5.The move also allows the Bishop on c8 to develop.
It is important for Black to proceed for active development of his pieces. Active development is always the best defence}

5. e3 {The pawn on d4 is reinforced and the Bishop on f1 is now ready to fly! Way to go White!}

5...Be6 {The Queen's Bishop is developed. A fair question would be why on the e6 square and not the f5 square where the Bishop controls more squares? It is because
if 5...Bf5 then White can play 6.dxc5 Bxc5 7.Qxd5 and win a pawn. The Bishop on e6 is now guarding the pawn on d5.Remember a natural looking move like ...Bf5 will allow White
to carry out his attack as Black cannot afford to loose a central pawn and open files for the White pieces.}

6.Nge2 {White develops the Knight but blocks the light-squared Bishop on f1. A much better alternative in my opinion was 6.Nf3
White needs to develop rapidly without losing too many tempi to justify giving up the Bishop pair}

6...Nc6 {More development for Black}

7.g3 {White also wants to develop the Bishop and castle soon. White could have also played 7.Qd2 followed by O-O-O}

7...cxd4 {Black alters the pawn structure and clears the c-file for the Rook on a8}

8.exd4 {8.Nxd4 is also possible.}

8...Bb4 {More active development for Black}

9.Bg2 O-O {Both sides develop pieces}

10.O-O Rc8 {Bringing the Rook to a nice semi-open diagonal.Simple chess}

11.a3 {White wants to win the Bishop pair by putting the question to the Bishop}

11...Ba5 {Black retreats back with the Bishop and keeps the Bishop pair.
11...Bxc3 is not attractive as 12.Nxc3 does give Black any good compensation for the relinquished
Bishop pair}

12.Nf4 {Attacking the pawn on d5 with the third piece}

12...Bxc3 {Eliminating one of the attackers and damaging the pawn structure in the process}

13.bxc3 Na5 {Looking to play ...Nc4 and land the Knight on an outpost}

14.Nxe6 fxe6 {White eliminates the other Bishop too but this is slightly erroneous as the pawn-structure for Black has improved.
14.Re1 was better that threatened to win the pawn on e6 after the exchange of the White Knight for the Black Bishop on e6}

15.Qd3 {Bad choice to protect the pawn on c3.}

15...f5 {Black wants to exert pressure on the c3 pawn. This preparatory move is to allow Black to play Nc4-d6-e4 and attack the pawn on c3.
Another important point to note - This move vacates the f6 square for the Rook on f8. ...Rf6 can lend support to the backward pawn on e6,if required}

16.f4 {White fixes the pawns on the f-file and vacates the f3 square for the Rook to defend the pawn on c3.Black's pawn on e6 is now backward
Instead of fixing the pawn-structure White could have tried 16.Rfe1 in order to put pressure on the backward e6 pawn}

16...Nc4 {The Knight begins it journey towards the e4 square. Nc4-d6-e4 is an idea to put pressure on the c3 pawn. Also this move attacks the pawn on c3 which means that the Rook on a1 cannot move immediately.
Thus this means that White has to waste a move and play a4 to save the pawn and relieve the Rook on a1 from baby-sitting duties!}

17.Rfb1 {Understandly White wants to break the shackles and attacks the b7 pawn in an attempt to penerate the seventh rank}

17...Rf7 {Black plans to play ...Rc6,...Rfc7,...Qc8 and create an Alekhine gun on the c-file to grab the c3 pawn}

18.Rb3 {Defending the b3 pawn. A better alternative was to play 18.Qe2  and attack the backward pawn on e6}

18...Rc6 {Protecting the e6 pawn in advance. In addition, Black vacates the c8 pawn for the Queen and also prepares to play ...Rfc7 and ...Na5 to capture the
pawn on c3}

19.Bf1? {A bad move. White's Queen on d3 blocks the sight of the Bishop. White seems to have no answers for Black's slow grinding play}

19...Qc8 {Black continues with his plan of creating an Alekhine gun on the c-file where all of his three heavy pieces will target the pawn on c3}

20.Be2 {White has resigned to the fact that the loss of the c3 pawn is inevitable}

20...Rfc7 {The Alekhine gun is ready on the c-file. 20...Na5 attacking the Rook was also possible. 21.Rb5 b6 and the pawn on c3 will fall on the next move.
But in this case Black will have to lose a few tempi to bring back the Knight into the game. 21...Nd6 is now the logical move that will allow Black to gobble up the pawn on c3}

21.Kh1? {A dubious move. 21.Qd1 with the idea of playing Bd3 next and protecting the c2 pawn was much better. 21.Qd1 Na5 22.Rb5 b6 and Black will capture the
pawn on c3. In t hat case, Bd3 would have allowed White to keep fighting}

21...Na5 {Gaining a tempo on the Rook and also evacuating the path for the Rook on c6 to gobble up the pawn on c3}

22.Rb2 {22.Rb5 b6 23.Qd1 Rxc3 24.Bd3 was perhaps better for White}

22...Rxc3 {Black crashes through and the pawn on c2 is also under fire}

23.Qb5 {Attacking  the Knight on a5}

23...Nc4 {Attacking the Rook on b2 and forcing White into a series of exchanges}

24.Bxc4 {White is better off to capture this Knight and ease the pressure}

24...R3xc4 {Capturing with the other Rook allows White to play Qxb7}

25.Rab1?!  {Bad decision. White adds more pressure on the b7 pawn but the d4 pawn is left hanging}

25...Rxd4 {Black is two pawns up and is in the driver's seat.White throws in the towel and resigns to avoid more pain.}0-1

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening.A popular choice that ranks along with 1.e4 called the King pawn opening}

1...Nf6 {A flexible opening move to combat White's opening move. This move is extremely flexible and controls the e4 square}

2.c4 {The best possible move controlling the d5 square}

2...e6 {This move frees the dark-squared Bishop's development and adds more control over the d5 square}

3.Nc3 {The most natural response. White is now ready to push e4 and grab the centre}

3...d5 {Black gets the pawn rolling on the central square and adds more control over the e4 square.The game has transposed into the Queen's gambit declined or the QGD}

4.cxd5 exd5 {The exchange variation of the QGD}

5.Bg5 {Putting pressure on the d5 pawn. This is the Carlsbad variation or the positional variation}

5...c6 {A solid move protecting the pawn on d5. White's main idea here is to make the development of Black's light-squared Bishop difficult and keep pressurising the pawn on d5}

6.Qc2 {Making ...Bf5 difficult for the moment. This is the Reshevsky variation of the QGD}

6...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

7.Bh4 {The Pin on the Knight is maintained}

7...Be7 {Developing the Kingside and also unpinning the Knight}

8.e3 {White begins his Kingside development}

8...O-O {Black has nicely played so far}

9.Bd3 {Creating the Bishop-Queen battery on the b1-h7 diagonal}

9...Re8 {The Rook is on a semi-open file. Good chess}

10.Nge2 {White does not want ...Bg4 and also keeps the options of playing f4 or Nf4 later in the game}

10...b6 {The light-squared Bishop will probably come to a6 or b7}

11.O-O {White too completes his Kingside development and the position is equal}

11...Ba6!? {A nice idea to exchange the light-squared Bishops. White has been playing so far with an attempt to make the life of the Bishop on c8 hard but
Black wants to terminate this problem for good}

12.Bf5 {White does not want to trade the Bishops to be consistent with his plan so far}

12...Nh5 {Black looks to trade the dark-squared Bishops.But I feel Black could have played 12...Bc8 and tried to exchange the Bishops of
lighter colours. Black's pawns are currently fixed on light squares and trading the dark-squared Bishops seems to be a positional error
12...Nbd7 was also playable with an intention of playing ...Nf8 and strengthening the Kingside. Also the Knight on h5 does not have anything concrete to do later and will have to retreat back to f6 wasting another tempo}

13.Bxe7 {White happily trades the inactive Bishop for his active counterpart}

13...Qxe7 {Correct recapture. 13...Rxe7 blocks the Queen on d8 and Black will have to waste another tempo to activate the Queen}

14.Rfe1 {The Knight on e2 is unpinned now and White exerts control of his own on the e-file. White is now aiming to play Ng3 followed by e4 with a sound game.}

14...Bb7  {A strange move. The Bishop goes to the worst possible square where the pawns on c6 and d5 obstruct its activity. Perhaps
Black wants to play ...Na6. 14...Nd7 looks much better.}

15.a3 {White prepares the Queen-side expansion with b4 to follow}

15...Nf6 {The Knight comes back to control the e4 square}

16.b4 {White pushes the pawn in a quest to expand on the Queenside}

16...Nbd7 {The Knight is developed connecting the Rooks}

17.Nf4{
Before White commits his a or b-pawn further, this Knight jump adds an attacker on the d5 pawn making Black's push of c5 harder.
17.Qb3 is also another idea - As White cannot push a4 immediately because the pawn on b4 will be lost after ....Qxb4.
This Queen move supports the pawn on b4 and now White can push a4 and b5 according to plan of Queenside expansion.
The Queen on b3 also adds more pressure on the d5 pawn. White can also play Nf4 later bringing a thrd attacker to the d5 pawn disallowing Black from play ..c5 and improving
the position of the Bishop on b7 and gaining space in the centre}

17...Qd6 {The Queen adds more protection to the pawn on d5}

18.Qb3 {The Queen not only protects the b5 advance but also eyes the d5 square making it harder for Black to achieve the pawn push ...c5}

18...a5 {Challenging the pawn on b4}

19.h3 {White waits as it is not clear whether Black will push ...b5 or capture ...axb4}

19...axb4 {Black releases the tension and opens up the a-file}

20.axb4 {White recaptures and the a-file is now opened up for an exchange of Rooks}

20...Reb8 {Black brings the Rook to assist the action on the Queenside}

21.Nd3 {The Knight position is improved and the Knight can go to e5 later to add pressure on the backward c6 pawn }

21...Nf8 {The Knight will probably come to e6}

22.Ne5 {The Knight puts additional pressure on the c6 pawn}

22...g6 {Black kicks the Bishop back}

23.Bd3 {Coming back to control the b5 square}

23...N6d7 {Black offers a draw here.}

24.f4 {Adding more protection to the e5 square. White's Knight is not going backwards. A space gaining move for White}

24...Rxa1 {Good to trade Rooks as Black does not have goood enough space}

25.Rxa1 Kg7 {Black waits before commiting anything}

26.Ra7 {Penetrating the seventh rank and hemming in the Rook's movement from b8}

26...f6 {The pesky Knight is driven back}

27.Nf3 {Now it is hard for Black to find good moves }

27...Qe7 {Attacking the pawn on e3 and seeking counterplay}

28.Kf2 {...Qxe3 is stopped}

28...b5 {Black fixes the b-pawn as it is becoming harder to find good alternatives}

29.f5 {White attacks the pawn on g6}

29..g5 { ...gxf5 exposes the Black King and is a bad idea}

30.e4 {Nice time to open up the centre}

30...dxe4 {It is better to play with open lines rather than getting suffocated. This move makes sense}

31.Bxe4 {The Bishop on b7 is a huge liability for Black as White now encircles the pawn duo on c6 and b5}

31...Nb6?! {The Bishop on b7 gets more protection at the cost of getting pinned and Black averts 32.Nxb5. But the c6 pawn is lost. A better move was 31...Qe8. }

32.Bxc6 {Taking advantage of the pin, White grabs a pawn}

32...Nc8 {Attacking the Rook and forcing a simplification}

33.Rxb7 Rxb7 {White forces the exchange of pieces and wants a superior endgame}

34.Bxb7 Qxb7 35.Qd5 {Offering to trade Queens too which Black agrees upon}

35...Qxd5 36.Nxd5 Kf7 {Black will have a difficult time defending as the path to the central squares is blocked for the moment}

37.Nd2 {The Knight is prepared to jump to e4}

37...Nd6 {Attacking the pawn on f5}

38.g4 {Simple move to find.}

38...Nd7 {The other Knight joins the party but there are no good squares for it at the moment}

39.Ke3 {The King comes closer to the center}

39...h5 {Hoping that White grabs the pawn and commits a self-goal}

40.Ne4 {Looking to trade Knights }

40...Nxe4 {40...Nc4+ 41.Kd3 was perhaps better a better line of defence for Black. This move further weakens Black's drawing chances}
41.Kxe4 {The King is in the centre of the board and ready to escort the d4 pawn to glory}
41...hxg4 42.hxg4 {Another pair of pawns go off the board}
42...Nb8 {The Knight needs to get back into the game.Idea is to play ..Nc6 or ...Na6 to attack the b4 pawn}
43.Nc7 {Attacking the b5 pawn but more importantly taking away the a6 square from the Black Knight}
43...Nc6 {Attacking the pawn on b4}
44.Na6 {Protecting the pawn}
44...Ne7 {Nothing great in sight}
45.d5 {The passed pawn moves forward taking away the c6 square}
45...Nc8 {...Nd6 is an idea}
46.Nc7 {Attacking the pawn on b5}
46...Nd6+ 47.Kd4 {Kc5 is the idea on the next move}
47...Ke7 {No defense is adequate without the King}
48.Kc5 {The pawn on b5 cannot be saved}
48...Kd7 {What else?}
49.Nxb5 Ne4+ {Black wants to grab the f5 and g4 pawns with the Knight dance!}
50.Kd4 Nf2 {Black will grab the g4 pawn next}
51.Nc3 {Ne4 followed by Nxf6 is the idea}
51...Nxg4 52.Ne4 {Black King has a difficult job managing the White pawns on b4 and d5}
52...Nh6 {Ready to grab the f5 pawn}
53.Nxf6+ Ke7 {The King will have a hard time defending White's passed pawns. In fact, the task looks insurmountable}
54.Ne4 Kd7 {Black does not grab the pawn with 54...Nxf5 55.Ke5 and the path is clear for White's d-pawn}
55.Nxg5 {Black has nothing to play for except defence}
55...Nxh5 56.Kc5 Nd6{White prepares b5 and it is game over for Black according to Nalimov tablebase.}1-0

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening.}

1...Nf6 {A hypermodern approach where Black controls the e4 and d5 squares with a piece. The pawn choices remain flexible depending on White's response}

2.c4 {The best move where White gains more space in the centre by exerting more control over the d5 square}

2...g6 {The King's Indian defence or the Grunfeld defence looks to be Black's choice of countering White's approach. Here Black will bring out the dark-squared
Bishop on f8 and control the a1-h8 diagonal.Black's emphasis is to develop activelyu and then counter-attack White's central control}

3.f3!? {A nice move. This moves serves three purposes. (a) Black could have responded with 3...d5 if White had played 3.Nc3 and challenged the centre immediately. This is the aggressive Grunfeld
defence giving Black great fighting chances. Although White has a great number of choices to counter this defence and obtain an advantage. By playing the text move White has killed 3...d5 as the Grunfeld reply lacks punch after
4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4!. Here White gains a  lot of space and the pawn on e4 is ably supported by his comrade on f3.
(b) The pawn on f3 eliminates the move ...Ng4 or ...Bg4 as of now limiting squares for Black's pieces.White can also prepare moves like g4 followed by h4 to get a pawn storm going and attack the Black Kingside
(c) White delays the move Nc3. The Queen's Knight on b1 can go to a3 or d2 depending upon Black's choices. White's idea will be to play O-O-O in an ideal situation followed by a King side attack.
Moves like Be3,Qd2,Nd2 and O-O-O are on the cards.}

3...d5 {Black sticks with the direct attempt to control the central e4 square with the Queen pawn. The Neo-Grunfeld move}

4.cxd5 Nxd5 {White captures the central pawn with the flank c-pawn and forces Black to recapture}

5.e4 {White grabs the centre with his central pawn duo.}

5...Nb6

6.Nc3 Bg7 {Attacking the pawn on d4}

7.Be3 {Developing the Queenside and also protecting the pawn}

7...O-O {Black castles and commits the King to g8}

8.Qd2 {Looking to plant the dark-squared Bishop on h6 later. O-O-O is now possible as White still lags in development}

8...Nc6 {Adding more pressure on the d4 pawn.8...e5 has also been played here in the spirit of the King's Indian defence}

9.O-O-O {White is now ready to work on the Kingside with a possible assault on the Black King. The d4 pawn is also defended thrice as the Rook on d1 joins the battle}

9...f5!? {Attacking the centre. Since WHite's Kingside development has yet not started, Black takes his opportunity to start his counterplay.}

10.e5 {White smothers the activity of the Bishop on g7 and keeps the centre closed. His main goal is to attain a long-term initiative on the Kingside. Meanwhile, his pieces on the Kingside still need to be developed}

10...Nb4 {The Knight will go back to d5 square which cannot be attacked by White pawns. Black is also looking at a possible plan of a Queenside
initiative with moves like ...a5,...Be6 and ...Na2+. }

11.Nh3 {The King's Knight is developed controlling the f4 square. It is important that 11.a3 should not be played as it unnecessarily weakens the pawn cover of the White King.}

11...Be6 {Attacking the pawn on a2 with this Bishop development.}

12.Kb1 {The King defends the pawn.12.a3 Na2+ is not desirable for White.}

12...Qd7 {Connecting the Rooks. The Queen can swing over to a4 but currently the White Knight on c3 controls it.}

13.Nf4 {White attacks Black's Bishop on e6. 13.Ng5 also looks a good option to exchange Black's dangerous looking Bishop on e6.
It was a tough decision to choose between Ng5 and Nf4.13.Ng5 Rfd8 14.h4 with an intention to open up the h-file against the Black King.14...h6 15.Nxe6 Qxe6
16.Bxh6? allows Black to counterattack.16...c5!? 17.d5 N4xd5 18.Nxd5 Rxd5 and Black looks better}

13...Rfd8 {Sensing more activity on the d5 square, Black improves the position of his King Rook further}

14.h4 {White goes for the flank attack planning to push h5.
14.Nxe6 Qxe6 does not work well for White as the Rook on d8 is doing a splendid job.
Black's Bishop on g7 is suddenly active as ...Bxe5 is threatened because of the pinned pawn.
15.f4 becomes necessary to avert the threat of 15...Bxe5. Then Black can continue his Queenside offensive with 15...a5}

14...Bf7 {Preserving his Bishop pair and also adding more control over the h5 square}

15.Qc1 {Stopping Black from playing ...Nc4 and indirectly controlling the c5 square which stops Black from playing ...c5}

15...Na4 {Black wants to trade his Knight with the defender of the a2 pawn sitting on the c3 square. 16.Nxa4?? loses to
16...Bxa2+ 17.Ka1 Qxa4 and Black has a winning attack. Black threatens ...Nc2+ on the next move.
18.Rd2?? Bb3+ 19.Kb1 Qa2# White will have to give up his Queen and just prolong the mating sequence.
Also this move from Black forces White to make a decision on the Queenside and stops him from executing his h4-h5 pawn push idea.
Another significant idea behind this move is that Black now is willing to bust open the Queenside with the pawn push ...c5 as the Knight on a4 controls the
c5 square. }

16.b3 {16.a3? is not a good choice as this allows Black great counterplay. 16...Nxc3+ 17.Qxc3 Nd5 18.Nxd5 Qxd5 and Black dominates the a2-f7 diagonal. With moves like ...b5 and ...c5 on the
cards, it looks Black will have a great attack. The move played blocks the a2-f7 diagonal and forces the Black Knight to be traded off.}

16...Nxc3 {Forced. 16...Nb6? is bad as 17.h5 allows White to execute his idea.17...g5 keeping the g-file closed.18. Nd3 Nxd3 19.Bxd3 h6 to stop White's pawn march.But then White can bust open the
Kingside with 20.f4 g4 keeping the g-file closed yet again. 21.Qc2 Be6 or 21...e6 allows White to play 22.d5! with a great spatial advantage}

17.Qxc3 {Now Black is forced to make a decision with the other Knight}

17...a5 {Nothing doing. The Knight remains in White's territory}

18.Bc4 {White wants to trade Black's annoying Bishop on f7}

18...e6 {A difficult choice. Black could have simplified with 18...Bxc4 19.Qxc4+ Nd5. The move made turns the Bishop on f7 into a
"tall pawn" but Black believes in his defence capabilities and hopes to scuttle White's plan of pushing h5}

19.a3 {The Knight has to go back now as White cannot push h5 as of now and just waits for a favourable exchange of pieces}

19...b5 {Black does not retreat with the Knight but gains more space on the Queenside with a tempo on the Bishop}

20.Be2 {Planning to push g4 at some point}

20...Nd5 {The Knight had to hop back}

21.Nxd5 Qxd5 {White had to trade his counterpart as the Queen was threatened from d5}

22.Qb2 {Preventing Black from pushing ...b4 with tempo. The Queen now paves the way for White's Rooks to control the c-file}

22...Rdc8 {Black wants to push ...c5 at some point}

23.Rd2 {The modus operandi is simple: play Rc2 and then bring the other Rook over to c1. Attack the c7 pawn and keep Black occupied }

23...Be8 {Controlling the c6 square. ...Ra6 followed by ...Rc6 to trade Rooks is a possibility}
24.Rc1 {As per plan}
24...Qb7 {The Queen defends the pawn on c7}
25.Rdc2 {White keeps up the pressure on the c-file}
25...Bf8 {Improving the Bishop's position}
26.Bg5 {The idea is to play Bf6 and then push h5 to open up lines against the Black King}
26...Qa7 {Black wants to push ...c5 as the stage is set for a Queenside assault}
27.Be3 {No c5 push for the moment}
27...Qb7 {Repeating the position again}
28.h5 {White decides to open up the h-file and divert the attention to the Kingside}
28...gxh5 {Black accepts the challenge}
29.f4 {Closing the f-file and asking Black to take up the gauntlet}
29...b4 {Black expands on the Queenside with the heavy artillery behind}
30.a4 {Keeping the pawn formation closed on the Queenside. 30.Bc4 looks attractive but then Black has sufficient counterplay.
30...Qe4 31.Bxe6+ Bf7 32.Bxf7 Kxf7 33.Re1 and Black looks okay}
30...Qe4 {Attacking the Bishop}
31.Bf2 {Only good square.31.Bg1 looks more passive as it can become a hindrance for the Rooks to switch over to the Kingside if needed}
31...Qxf4 {Grabbing a pawn}
32.Bf3 {The Bishop does a fair job here}
32...c6 {32...Rab8 makes the Rook passive. Instead Black is more than happy to allow 33.Bxc6 and exchange pieces to reduce passive play}
33.Rc4 {White wants to push d5 with a tempo on the Black Queen}
33...Bg7 {If d4 is pushed then the e5 pawn will lose support and Black hopes to negate White's attempt of pushing d5}
34.Ka2 {A waiting move}
34...Kh8 {The ball is back in White's court and it is time to make a decision as White is two pawns down}
35.d5!? {Another pawn sacrifice on the offing but Black Queen is under attack.35.Rh1 is a weak attempt to win the h5 pawn.35...Qg5 protects it.
36.Qe2 with another attacker to the h5 pawn. But then 36...Bh6 intending to play ...Qd2+ and exchanging Queens. 37.Rc2 allows Black to play 37...Qe7 and
giving up the h5 pawn would do wonders for Black's defence}
35...Qxe5 {The Queen has to grab the pawn and threaten ...Qxb2# on the next move. 35...Qg5? is suicidal after 36.dxc6 and White's Bishop pair
will allow the safe escort of the passed pawn on c6. 36...Rc7 37.Bb6 Rac8 38.Bxa5 followed by Bxb4 and White have a new pair of passed pawns with a winning game}
36.Bd4 {Forcing the Queen to g3 or c7 as the Bishop on g7 will need support after the Queen moves from e5}
36...Qg3 {Protecting the Bishop on g7 from g3}
37.dxc6 {37.dxe6 does not achieve anything for White.}
37...e5 {Closing the dark diagonal by attacking the Bishop}
38.c7!? {The pawn push opens up an attack on the Rook on a8 while the Rook on c8 will have to do babysitting for a while and
create a blockade}
38...Bf7 {The Bishop attacks the Rook on c4}
39.Bxa8 {38.Bf2 is also good for White.38...e4 is forced or else 38...Qg6 39.Bxa8 is winning for White.
39.Bxg3 Bxb2 40.Bxh5 Bxc1 41.Bxf7 and White's pieces are all over the board}
39...Bxc4 40.Bf2 Bxb3+ 41.Qxb3 Qxf2+ 42.Kb1 Qb6 {Preventing 43.Bb7 with an intention of dislodging the Rook from the Queening square}
43.Qd3 {The only winning move for White as White threatens Qd7 to attack the Rook on c8.How will the Black Queen neutralise
her counterpart's threat?. 44.Qd7 or 44.Qxf5 allow White to threaten the Rook on c8.44...Rxc7?? 45.Qd8+ Bf8 46.Qxf8#}
43...e4 {Black tries to prevent 44.Qxf5}
44.Qd7 {White continues with his plan. Will the Rook vacate the c8 square?}
44...Qa6 {The Queen supports the Rook}
45.Qxc8+!! {The Queen sacrifice paves the way for White's material gains}
45...Qxc8 46.Bb7 {Take me as well shouts the Bishop! Black resigned}

1.d4 Nf6 {The most popular response to the Queen's pawn opening where Black keeps his pawn options open.}
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence}

4.Qc2 {The classical variation or Capablanca variation wherein White Queen controls the e4 square.
More importantly, the Queen is also protecting the Knight and will capture Qxc3 after Black trades the dark-squared Bishop for the Knight}

4...Nc6 {The Zurich variation where the Knight attacks the d4 pawn immediately}

5.Nf3 {Adding protection to the pawn. Best continuation as practice suggests}

5...d6 {Black wants to play ...e5 later. This is the preparatory move}

6.Bd2 {The Knight is unpinned and White now threatens to push e2-e4 gaining a great pawn centre. 5.e4 was also possible but then 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 gives White doubled pawns. 6.Qxc3 is not possible as 6...Nxe4 wins a pawn
The whole idea behind 4.Qc2 was to avoid doubled pawns. Hence 5.Bd2 is the more logical continuation}

6...O-O {The Rook can now come to e8 and assist in the pawn push ...e5}

7.a3 {White now gets the Bishop pair - the second key idea in this variation for White.}

7...Bxc3 8.Bxc3 {The e4 square needs Queen's protection so that White can play e2-e4 later. Hence the recapture with the Bishop}

8...Re8 {8...Qe7 is also another good alternative but then 9.e4!? e5 10.d5 Nb8
This is playable for Black but the position is cramped. But now if White decides to pursue a massive centre with 9.e4 then 9...e5 10.d5 allows Black to
play 10...Ne7 since the e7 square is vacant. This Knight can then jump to g6 or f5 later. Hence I feel that the move 8...Re8 is better than 8...Qe7.Now Black is ready to push ...e5 on the next move}

9.Rd1 {X-raying the Queen and this means Black cannot push ...e5 now. 9...e5?
10.dxe5 wins a pawn as Black cannot recapture with the pinned pawn on d6.White could have also played 9.O-O-O and brought the
Rook to d1 but perhaps it is a tad riskier}

9...Bd7 {Black is ready to push ...e5 again as the Bishop on d7 blocks the Queen on d8 from White's Rook }

10.d5 {White pushes ahead and attacks the Knight.Another worthy try was 10.e4 vacating the e2 and d3 squares for the light-squared Bishop and creating a strong centre}

10...Nb8  {White does not gain too much by kicking the Knight as his own Bishop on f1 and the King are stuck. White will require another three moves
to complete Kingside development.}

11.dxe6 {White opens up the d-file and releases the tension hoping to exploit Black's Queenside development. But it must be remembered that White's Kingside
development is also iffy and quick measures were required to rectify this problem. 11.e3 looks more sensible}

11...Bxe6 {11...Rxe6 runs into a problem. 12.Ng5! attacking the Rook. 12...Re8 13.Bxf6 Qxf6 14.Qxh7+ Kf8 15.Qh5 and White has a strong initiative}

12.e3 {Protecting the pawn on c4 and preparing Be2}

12...Nbd7 {Black wants to complete Queenside development. This move also controls the c5 square and thus deters White from pushing c5 himself}

13.Be2 {Preparing Ng5 and O-O}

13...Bg4 {The Bishop is trying to rescue itself from being captured. The idea is to redirect the Bishop to h5 and g6 where it will have a great influence}

14.O-O {Development completed}

14...Ne4 {Attacking the Bishop, the Knight occupies the central e4 square}

15.Be1 {The Bishop remains safe on e1}

15...a5 {Expanding on the Queenside with control over the b4 square}

16.Nd4 {Looking to simplify}

16...Bxe2 17.Nxe2 {17.Qxe2 is also okay}
17...a4 {Black does not allow b4 with advantage for White}
18.f3 {Kicking the Knight back}
18...Nec5 {18...Nef6 scuttles the Knight's activity as it does not have good squares to jump in the future}
19.e4 {The pawn on e3 was under attack. White pushes it forward and grabs the central square}
19...Qg5 {Preventing 20.Nf4. Also Black intends to play ...Ne5 and then create a Kingside initiative}
20.Bf2 {Attacking the Knight on c5. Also controlling the e3 square}
20...f6 {Strengthening the e5 square further and Black waits}
21.Nc3 {Nd5 is an idea}
21...Qh5 {...Qf7 is the idea to bring back the Queen}
22.Ra1 {A weird move to say the least. What is White's idea? It is hard to say anything logical.22.Nd5 looked a good continuation.}
22...Qf7 {22...Nb3 looks menacing but then 23.Rae1 and the Knight on b3 has to go back.}
23.Nd5 {Attacking the pawn on c7}
23...Ne5 {The Queen defends the c7 pawn}
24.Rad1 {The Rook is back on d1}
24...Nb3 {White's plan is unclear. It seems that Rd2 followed by Rfd1 is an idea. Playing f4,g3 also looks a possibility for White.
The move played halts White from playing Rd2}
25.Rfe1 {Improving the Rook's scope and White is ready to push f4.}
25...Rac8 {...Nd7 will be the reply if White plays 26.f4. The pawn on c7 is protected with this Rook move}
26.Ne3 {The Knight on d5 goes back and White's intentions are not clear at the moment.}
26...Ra8 {The Rook has nothing special to do on c8. Hence goes back}
27.Nd5 {Looking for a three-fold repetition as Black is low on time.}
27...Rac8 {Protecting the c7 pawn again as Black lowers his guard.}
28.h3 {White too makes another diffident move}
28...Nd7 {No commitment as well from Black}
29.Kh1 {The White King is also joining the party now of making boring moves with no intention of forcing concrete ideas}
29...Ndc5 {The Knight goes to the Queenside again}
30.Rf1 {White Rook is now back to the Kingside}
30...Ne6 {Going back to the Kingside}
31.Ne3 {Repositioning the Knight to go to the Kingside}
31...Ned4 32.Qc3 {The Queen is safe here and the Knight on d4 is attacked twice now}
32...Ne6 33.Kg1 Nf4 34.Qc2 Ra8 35.Rfe1 Qg6 36.Kh2 Kh8 37.Bg3 {Attacking the Knight}
37...Ne6 {Retreats without any problem}

1.e4 e6 {The French defense.}

2.d4 d5 {Black claims his share of the centre but in the process makes the development of the light-squared Bishop difficult}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation which Garry Kasparov considers to be the best response.}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation}

4.e5 {The advanced Winawer.}

4...c5 {Attacking the d4 pawn - the main motif here when White creates a d4-e5 pawn complex}

5.a3 {White grabs the Bishop pair but at the cost of doubled pawns}

5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch-Hook variation where the c3 pawn is attacked followed by ideas explained next.}

7.Bd2 {The best defense}

7...Qa4!? {The Queen move that pressurises the pawn on c2 as well as the pawn on d4. White's main plan is to attack the dark-squared pawn on g7 by playing Qg4 in the advanced Winawer.
But now the c2 pawn will loose support if White wishes to pursue his main idea of controlling the dark-squares.}

8.Qb1 {White threatens Bb5+ winning the Queen on the next move}

8...c4 {Black closes the centre and ensures that White's Bishops are impaired for the time being}

9.Nh3!? {Nice move. Although it looks weird but White's idea is to play Nf4-h5 and then attack the g7 pawn. White wants Black to push g7-g6
and weaken the dark squares around the King}

9...Nc6 {Black develops the Queen's Knight and prepares ...Bd7 followed by O-O-O. This is the standard plan in this variation for Black}

10.Nf4 {A follow-up to the last move. Attacking the g7 pawn via Nh5 is the idea but Black is comfortable here}

10...Bd7 {Black prepares O-O-O}

11.Be2 {White is ready to castle on the Kingside. A better way to develop the Bishop, in my opinion, was to play g3 and then follow up with Bg2 or Bh3.
This would have allowed the  light-squared Bishop to eye the Queenside where Black's King in most likelihood will be stationed}

11...O-O-O {Black castles long and aims to push ...f6 followed by ...Rf8 with activity on the Kingside}

12.O-O {White brings out the last piece in to the game and protects the King}

12...f6 {The thematic French pawn break for Black attacking the e5 pawn and looking to open up the f-file}

13.Bg4!? {Attacking the e6 pawn twice instead. 13.exf6 Nxf6 gives Black nice development but White is still okay.}

13...Re8 {13...f5 locks the entire pawn structure and would have made it impossible for Black's pieces to find meaningful squares later}

14.Nh5 {Looks like White wants to keep attacking pawns. The pawn on g7 is now a target.
But it is important to note that once Black defends the pawn then the Knight on h5
will have to go back to find meaningful work which will allow Black to re-group and possibly get a better position.}

14...Re7 {An ugly looking Rook move but essential in the context of the game as the g7 pawn needs protection.
14...fxe5 does not look promising. 15.Nxg7 Re7 16.Nh5 exd4 17.Re1 and White will pile up immense pressure on the e6 pawn
It is better for Black to exchange central pawns at an apt moment.
14...f5 is also playable but it is difficult to for Black to generate any counterplay.}

15.Re1 {Activating the Rook on the e1 square from which the e5 square is controlled}

15...fxe5 {Opening up the f-file after the brief surge from White's minor pieces}

16.dxe5 {The only good looking move. 16.Bg5 with an attack on the Rook is also possible but then 16...Rf7 seems to be okay for Black.17.Nf4 Nd8 with added protection to the pawn on e6}

16...b6 {A prophylactic move that stops the White Queen from infiltrating the b7 square. White can play moves like Qb2,Rb1 and pressurise the pawn on b7. This move stops such ideas and throws
the ball back into White's court.}

17.Bh3 {The pressure on e6 is maintained and White too does not want to break the ice}

17...Rf7 {Vacating the e7 square for the Knight on g8. After having taken precautionary measures it is time for Black to occupy the f-file and then develop
the pieces on g8 and h8}

18.Nf4 {White again attacks the pawn on e6 with the Knight}

18...Nd8 {The other Knight comes to the rescue. Now if we look at the position it seems that White wasted many tempi in attacking the e6 and the g7 pawns without actually gaining anything
His Bishop on h3 isn't doing anything great and so too the Knight on f4. On the other hand, Black's Knight on g8 is poised to be developed on e7 followed by ...Rhf8 with some pressure going on the
f-file.}

19.Ne2 {White loses another tempo with the Knight as its utility on f4 has been finished.}

19...Ne7 {Black needs to involve his Knight and also the Rook on h8 to join the battle.}

20.Nd4 {The pressure on e6 is reinforced}

20...Nec6 {Asking the Knight on d4 to take a decision. Black wants to eliminate the sustained pressure on e6}

21.Qc1 {Preparing Rb1 as the pawn on a3 is protected by the Queen}

21...Rg8 {21...Rhf8 looks tempting as the f2 pawn is attacked but then 22.f4 stalls Black's plans as the f4 square is adequately protected.
The Rook on f8 will then have to go back to g8 and prepare for ...h6 and ...g5. This move saves a precious tempo}

22.g3 {Preparing to place pawns on the dark squares and create a wall. Why not play f4 directly without any preparation? Another possible idea
from White is 23.Bg2 and White would give up the incessant pressure on the e6 pawn in return for some other activity for the light-squared
Bishop }

22...h6 {Preparing 23...g5 in case White opts for 23.Bg2}

23.f4 {Halting Black's ...g5 idea. But the dark-squared Bishop on will find d2 will have a hard time doing something worthwhile}

23...Kb8 {The King is safer here as Black waits for White to spell out his action}

24.Rb1 {White turns his attention on the Queenside as the Rook enters into action}

24...g6 {Cementing more control over the f5 square, Black plans to play ...Ne7 followed by ...Nf5}

25.Be3 {The Bishop remains hemmed in by its own pawns}

25...Ne7 {The Knight will go to f5 and blunt White's Bishop on h3. 25...Nxd4 is also okay but 26.cxd4 only helps White to undouble his pawns}

26.Rb4 {Putting the question to the Black Queen}

26...Qa5 {White can now push a4. 26...Qa6 is also possible}

27.a4 {Denying the a4 square, White wants to play Nb5 followed by Nxa7 wrecking Black King's defences}

27...Nec6 {27...Nf5 is bad as 28.Bxf5 gxf5 29.Nb5 Nc6 30.Qa3 and White has great activity on the Queenside. Attacking the Rook on b4, Black wants to curtail White's
activity}

28.Rb5 {Attacking the Queen again and leaving the a4 pawn as a sacrifice. Will Black accept it?}
28...Qxa4 {Black accepts the pawn and opens up the a-file for White. It is time for White to justify the pawn sacrifice.}

29.Rb1 {With the idea of playing Ra1 and trapping the Black Queen}

29...Nxd4 {Vacating the c6 square for the Queen. 29...Qa5? Black cannot be greedy with his pawn grabbing ideas. 30.Ra1 Qxc3? 31.Nb5 with a fork on the
Queen and the a7 pawn. Black will get busted here. 29...Qa6?! is also a defensive move that will allow White great counterplay.
30.Ra1 Na5 31.Qa3 Ka8 32.Reb1 and White gets what he wanted when he decided to sacrifice a pawn on move 28}
30.cxd4 {30.Bxd4 is also fair}
30...Nc6 {Protecting the pawn on a7 in advance}
31.Ra1 Qb4 {The Queen can run away to f8 or e7}
32.c3 {Attacking the Queen again}
32...Qf8 {The Queen is safe here}
33.Qb2 {The Rook on f1 will also be brought onto the b-file in all likelihood}
33...Bc8 {Clearing the b7 square for the Rook to come into play}
34.Qb5 {Attacking the Knight}
34...Qe8 {The Knight is protected}
35.Bc1 {The Bishop improves itself}
35...Ne7 {Offering to trade Queens}
36.Qb1 {Not a good idea to exchange Queens after you have sacrificed a pawn in search of an attack}
36...Nf5 {The Knight acts as an excellent piece to cut off the incessant vigil of the White bishop on the e6 pawn and frees his own Bishop on c8 to do meaningful
work}
37.Ba3 {The Bishop is ready to go to d6}
37...Rb7 {Shoring up the b-file and Black is ready to push ...a5}
38.Qa2 {White vacates the b1 square for the King's Rook}
38...Ka8 {Not allowing the annoying Bd6+ with tempo}
39.Reb1 {As planned}
39...Qd8 {Bd6 is out of question for White now. If 40.Bc5 then 40...Qc7 allows Black to over protect the pawn on a7}
40.Qe2 {White is expecting 40...g5. 41.Bxf5 exf5 42.e6 and White will be better}
40...Qd7 {Waiting move. The Queen can now swing to g7 or h7 and Black aim to play ...g5}
41.Bc1?! {White could have played 41.Bb4 and the Bishop looks far better on b4.White cannot stop Black from pushing ...g5 with this move.}
41...Qf7 {Adding more protection to the Knight on f5 before pushing ...g5}
42.Qa2 {The Queen keeps moving back and forth with no clear plan}
42...g5 {Black decides to play on the Kingside and expands on the g-file. The idea is to break open the door towards the White King.}
43.Bxf5 {White has had enough of the pesky Knight on f5 and gives up the Bishop pair. White could have tried 43.Bg4 instead. The dark-squared Bishop hopes to make it to d6
and White is hoping to play with an opposite-coloured Bishop ending in the long run. There is also a subtle trap here with White hoping for Black to respond with ...Qxf5?!}
43...exf5 {43...Qxf5?! 44.Rxb6 and White wins back his pawn. The Rook on b6 cannot be captured. 44...Rxb6?? 45.Qxa7#. The pawn on e5 for White is a passed pawn but it lacks
a bright future as the e6 square is difficult for White's pieces to access.}
44.Qg2 {The Queen is ready to defend the Kingside as Black threatens to expand}
44...Qd7 {Not allowing Rb5 that would have allowed White to attack the d5 pawn twice}
45.Ra2 {White wants to build up pressure on the a-file.
It is also possible that the Rook on a2 will go to b2 and then White will play Rb5 to apply more pressure on the d5 pawn.}
45...Rg6 {Adding more control over the sixth rank,Black waits}
46.h3 {Waiting move again}
46...Qf7 {The Queen moves and Black throws the ball in White's court again}
47.Kh2 {As slow as it can get!}
47...a5 {Black decides to use the passed pawn to good effect. The plan is to use the light-squared Bishop, the Queen and smother
White for space  on the a and the b-files}
48.Be3 {Another move from the tall pawn!}
48...Bd7 {Black's perennial problem piece in the French defence controls the a4 square}
49.Bc1 {What else than have some fun with the spineless piece!}
49...Qe6 {The Queen will now come to e8 or d7 in a bid to exert more influence over the a4 square}
50.Qf1 Bc6 {The d5 pawn is protected}
51.Ba3 Ka7 {The King is safe here and White has to make yet another decision}
52.Bc1 Rg8 {Black plans to plant the Rook on a8 if required or else continue with ...Qg6 and create some chances on the Kingside}
53.Qf2 {Another waiting move!}
53...Qg6 {Black wants to open up the game later with ...gxf4 depending on White's play}
54.Be3 {White does not do anything significant and keeps up throwing the ball back into Black's court}
54...Kb8 {Black is ready to swing the Rook on g8 to a8 but before that the King needs to be tucked to safety.}
55.Bc1 {With an idea of Ba3-Bd6}
55..Kc8 {The King wants to move away towards the Kingside and allow the remaining forces to create a Queenside passed pawn}
56.Qc2 {White threatens 57.g4}
56...Qe6 {The Queen creates a blockade on e6 and nullifies the threat of 57.g4}
57.Rba1 Kd8 58.Qb1 Kc7{Draw agreed}1/2-1/2

1. d4 e6 {1...Nf6 and 1...d5 are more common but the text move is a subtle move-order change avoiding lines of the Trompowsky attack after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5}
2.c4 Nf6

3.Nf3 {Avoiding the Nimzo-Indian}

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian defence}

4.Nbd2 {A passive option that aims to win the Bishop pair of Black by playing a3 on the next move.}

4...b6 {Black will fianchetto the other Bishop to b7}

5.a3 {White wants the Bishop pair}

5...Bxd2+ {Black gives up the Bishop pair as the retreat is not considered healthy}

6.Qxd2 {A passive move blocking the dark-squared Bishop.6.Bxd2 is the better move}

6...Bb7 {Controlling the a8-h1 diagonal}

7.e3 {White wants to develop his Kingside now}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development and also brings the Rook into the game}

8.Be2 {White too intends to O-O soon}

8...a5 {White wants to O-O and play b4 gaining space on the Queenside. White will then follow up with Bb2.This move prevents White
from pushing b2-b4}

9.b3 {White does not allow Black to push ...a4 which would make the pawn push b2-b3 impossible and throttle his Queenside development}

9...d6 {Prepares ...Nbd7 followed by the pawn push ...e5 or ...c5}

10.Bb2 {A natural follow-up to the last move where the dark-squared Bishop is fianchettoed}

10...Ne4!? {Black occupies the e4 square with a tempo on the White Queen. Black plans to play ...Nbd7,...f5 and a possible ...c5 or ...e5.}

11.Qc2 {The Queen now eyes the Knight and White threatens to cut off the Bishop-Knight combination on e4 with the pawn push d5}

11...Nd7 {More control over the c5 and e5 squares}

12.O-O {White completes his development and connects the Rooks}

12...f5 {Black overprotects the e4 square as White threatens to push d5 soon}

13.d5 {White gains space in the centre and creates a light-square pawn complex on the Queenside squares b3-c4-d5. I feel that this pawn advance is a little premature where White commits his pawn structure.
13.Rad1 looks more flexible where White threatens d5 later.}

13...e5 {Keeping the centre closed and gaining space.Black is now ready to play on the Kingside with moves like ...Rf6,...Rg6 or even ...Ng5}

14.Nd2 {White wants the pesky Knight on e4 to be traded. White also prepares to push f3-f4 or f4 to gain space and make his pieces active}

14...Nxd2 15.Qxd2 {Black trades his Knight and White manages to remove Black's annoying piece on e4}

15...Nc5 {Attacking the pawn on b3}

16.Qc2 {Defends and White is ready to push b4, gain space on the Queenside and kick the Knight back again}

16...Qe8 {The Queen from e8 can switch over to g6 for a Kingside initiative. Also, the Queen now guards the crucial a4 square which can be used by the
Knight on c5 later. This move deters White from pushing b4 immediately and gaining space on the Queenside at the expense of the Black Knight on c5.
Also Black prepares to push ...a4 and then post the Knight on b3 where it will act as a thorn in White's flesh}

17.f3 {A complicated continuation to understand. Controlling the e4 square is understandable that denies the Black Knight on c5 from becoming more proactive }

17...Bc8 {Improving the position of the Bishop. The Bishop will come to d7 later and free the Black Queen from controlling the e8-a4 diagonal}

18.b4 {White puts the question to the Knight...d7 or the a4 square?}

18...Na4 {18...Nd7 has a potential problem that allows White to play 19.Bc3}

19.Bc1 {White protects the Bishop pair }

19...Bd7 {Now the Queen on e8 does not have to do defensive duty and is free to go on the Kingside}

20.Bd3 {Increasing the pressure on the f5 pawn, White improves the position of the Bishop on e2}

20...Qf7 {The Queen waits for White to make a decision. The main idea to jump with his Queen over to the Kingside and then launch a pawn storm with ...h5 and ...g5
The game is complicated as White does have chances on the Queenside.}

21.Bd2 {Connecting the Rooks}

21...Qe7 {The Queen is ready to go to g5 or h4}

22.Kh1 {White puts the ball in Black's court again. 22.Rab1 was perhaps a better alternative }

22...Qf6 {Black too waits and keeps the Queen on a dark square}

23.Rab1 {White wants to push c5 at some point. This is a preparatory move towards a Queenside expansion as Black has dithered so far from a
Kingside offensive}

23...Qe7 {The Queen is only dancing around!}

24.Rfc1 {The Rook adds weight to the Queenside and White wants to push c5 at some point}
24...Kh8 {The only move that does not weaken the pawn structure. 24...h5 or ...h6 is too commital}
25.e4 {White pushes in the centre}
25...f4 {Keeping the structure closed is the way to go}
26.Qd1 {Bc2 is on the cards as White wants to get going at the stuck Knight on a4.Also 27.c5 is a powerful idea}
26...axb4 {Preventing White from pushing c5}
27.axb4 {27.Bxb4? is bad as as the Bishop does not have to do anything great on the Queenside and Black can quickly launch a
Kingside offensive with 27...g5 followed by ...h5. White will have to bring back the dark-squared Bishop back on e1 and waste a tempo}
27...g5 {Black begins a Kingside expansion with ...h5,...g4 and ...Rg8 on the cards}
28.Bf1 {The Bishop comes back to shore up the Kingside defence}
28...h5 {...g4 is on the cards next}
29.Ra1 {With the idea of playing Rc2 followed by Rca2 and attack the Black Knight on a4}
29...g4 {Black is aggressive and wants to open up the Kingside}
30.Rc2 {As planned. The Rook can also switch over to g2 in the future}
30...g3 {Black continues with the aggression as ...Qh4 is on the cards}
31.Rca2 {Attacking the paralysed Knight on a4 as White can afford to neglect Black's aggression at the moment.}
31...b5 {The only good continuation.31...Qh4 32.h3 b5 and Black will have to waste another Queen move to put it to concrete use.}
32.c5!? {Is this the winning move for White? Only time will tell. This move takes away the b6 square from the Knight and White threatens c6.White also invites
32...dxc5 33.bxc5 Qxc5 34.Rc1 creating an isolated pawn on c7 to target in the future. 32.cxb5 Nb6 allows the Knight back into the game and Black can hope to fight being a pawn down.}
32...Rg8 {Black wants to play ...Qh4 forcing White to stave off mate by playing h3. Then ...Bxh3 can force a draw. 32...dxc5 is dangerous as 33.bxc5 Qxc5 allows 34.Rc2 and the pawn on c7
will eventually fall paving the way for intrusion of the White's army}
33.Qe1 {A stout move guarding the h4 square with an X-ray. At first sight, it looks as 33.c6 is much more troublesome for Black. 33...Qh4 34.h3
But Black has a great defensive resource.34...Bxh3!! 35.gxh3 g2+ 36.Bxg2 Rxg2! 37.Kxg2 Rg8+ and the Queen-Rook battery ensure a perpetual check for Black }
33...c6 {Not allowing the c6 pawn push from White. 33...dxc5 34.bxc5 Qxc5 is slow poison for Black. After the Rooks double on the c-file, the c7 pawn will be lost and White will consolidate the position}
34.Rc2 {More pressure on the c-file}
34...Rg6 {The Rook comes to the defence of the sixth rank pawns.}
35.Rac1 {Doubling the Rooks on the c-file as White prepares to exchange pawns and open up the floodgates}
35...Ra6 {Coming to the sixth rank as the game will open up after the pawns are exchanged.35...cxd5? 36.c6 is strong as the passed pawn will pose a serious headache for Black.
36.exd5 preparing c6 on the next move is also annoying for Black. 35...dxc5 36.bxc5 allows White to plant two pawns on the fifth rank. It also
vacates the b4 and a5 squares for the White Bishop to reactivate itself on an important square exacerbating Black's pain. }
36.dxc6 {Opening up the d-file with an attack on the Bishop now}
36...Qh4 {An important move in the context of the game. By threatening mate on h2, Black forces White to keep the pawn structure closed.
This move tames chances of White's Bishop pair as we shall see in the game.}
37.h3 {Forced}
37...Bxc6 {Forced or else Black has lost material for nothing}
38.cxd6 {Another pawn grabbed to open up lines}
38...Bd7 {The Bishop was attacked}
39.Bc3?! {A move that neutralises White's chances.White attacks the tail of the long pawn chain complex.}
39...Nxc3 {The Knight is finally off the board and Black can breathe easy.It is more important to remove one of the key attackers of the
dark squares. 39...Re6? looks good at the outset but if we delve deeper, then it is actually a terrible move.40.Ba1! keeps the tension alive and Black's
Knight on a4 is virtually out of the game.}
40.Qxc3 {The Queen joins the party now and attacks the e5 pawn.40.Rxc3 does not come with an attack on the e5 pawn. This allows 40...Rxd6 instantly and Black is okay}
40...Qg5 {The pawn on e5 is safe for the moment. 40...Re6? is a terrible move. 41.Bxb5! wins for White. 41...Bxb5?? 42.Qc8+ with a double attack on the Rook on e6.
42...Re8 is forced. 43. d7! Rd8 44.Qxd8 Qxd8 45.Rc8 pinning the Queen and White will bring another Queen on the d8 square soon.
41...Raxd6 is a tad better but nevertheless lost for Black. 42.Bc4 Re8 43.b5 and White can safely escort the passed pawn as the heavy artillery on the c-file is enough.
40...Qf6 is also a mistake as the Rook on g6 loses access to the pawn on d6. 41.Rd1! Rxd6 42.Rxd6 Qxd6 43.Rd2 Qe7 44.Qc7 Rg7 45.Rd5 Kh7 46.Rxe5
and Black's pawn chain is wrecked.}
41.Qc5 {Attacking the b5 pawn twice}
41...Raxd6 {41...Rgxd6 also looks playable. 42.Bxb5 Bxb5 43.Qxb5 Ra8 44.Rc6 looks strong. Here White offers to trade Rooks
44...Qe7 45.Rc5 with another attacker added on the e5 pawn.45...Rad8 threatening 46...Rd1+ with dire consequences.46.Rd5 solves White's
problems and Black is again on the defensive.}
42.Bxb5 Bxb5 43.Qxb5 {White is now a pawn up}
43...Rg8 {This Rook will now switch to d8 and create threats on the d-file.White has back rank issue to be sorted out.}
44.Rc6 {Looking to trade Rooks and liquidate}
44...Qe7 {The Queen comes back to support the Rook}
45.R6c5 {The Rook goes back to attack the e5 pawn twice}
45...Rgd8 {Threatening mate on d1 square}
46.Rd5 {Blocking Black's intention}
46...Kg7 {The King now comes down to add more protection to the pawn chain}
47.Rcd1 {Adding more support to the Rook on d5}
47...Rxd5 {Eliminating one of the Rooks}
48.exd5 {48.Rxd5 leads to a draw 48...Qc7 and White needs to address his back rank issues}
48...Kf6 49.Qc6+ Rd6 50.Qc5 Qd8 51.Kg1 Ke7 52.Kf1 h4 53.Rd2 {White plans to play Ke2 and then shield the King against checks on the
second rank}
53...Qb6 {Offers to exchange Queens as the Rook on d6 is currently pinned}
54.Ke2 {No checks here}
54...Kd7 {Waiting move}
55.Kd1 {The King will now come to the c-file in all probability }
55...Qa6 {With the idea of invading the light a6-f1 diagonal}
56.b5 {Blocking the diagonal and the passed pawn moves forward}
56...Qb6 {Queen exchanges will not help White}
57.Qc4 {Waiting move}
57...Kd8 {Black too awaits}
58.Qb4 {Another waiting move}
58...Qc7 {Blocking the King's entry onto the c-file}
59.Rd3 {Rc3 seems to be the idea to attack the Queen followed by Kc2}
59...Qb6 {59...Ke7 leads to a pinned Rook. With this Queen Black aims to harass the Black King with moves likes ...Qf2}
60.Kc2 {As planned}
60...Kd7 {Another waiting move as Black does not have too many choices}
61.Kb3 {The King marches towards the centre}
61...Qg1 {The Queen will harass the Black King from the first rank}
62.Qe4 {The Queen gets out of the way and attacks the e5 pawn. The White King can now come to c4 and take shelter of the pawn on b5
and may be go to the sixth rank in the future}
62...Qb1+ {The checking harassment begins}
63.Kc4 {As planned the King moves closer to the centre}
63...Qc2+ 64.Kb4 Qb2+ 65.Rb3 Qxg2 66.Qh7+ Kd8 67.Qh4+ Ke8 68.Qh8+ {Attacking the e5 pawn}
68...Kf7 69.Qh7+ 69...Kf6 70.Qh6+ Ke7* {Forced or the Rook will go}

1...d5 {Identical response from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's Gambit}

2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is on the board}

3.Nc3 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on the d5 pawn.}

3...Nf6 {Black protects the d5 pawn further}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {4...Nxd5 is also a playable option that does not allow the annoying pin on g5}

5.Bg5 {The positional variation or the Carlsbad variation where the Knight is pinned and pressure applied on the d5 pawn}

5...c6 {A solid response protecting the pawn on d5.}

6.Qc2 {The Reshevsky variation where the main idea is to make life of the Bishop on c8 difficult. This move robs the f5 square}

6...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

7.Bh4 {Better to keep the pin rather than retreating with Bd2 or Bf4}

7...Bd6 {Black wants to castle soon}

8.e3 {Prepares Bd3 and Kingside development}

8...O-O 9.Bd3 {White develops the Bishop and adds more steel to the b1-h7 diagonal}
9...Re8 {The Rook is developed on the semi-open file considering the fact that White's King is still on the e1 square}

10.Nge2 {White's Knight does not come to the natural f3 square as this allows Black to play ...Bg4. White's main idea here
is to restrict the development of the Bishop on c8 as much as he can.}

10...Na6 {Black wants to play ...Nb4 and eliminates White's light-squared Bishop.But I feel that this is a hasty move. 10...b6 followed by ...Bb7 or ...Nbd7 was better}

11.Bxa6 bxa6 {White damages the pawn structure and is looking to exploit the doubled a-pawns and the backward c6 pawn in the long run}

12.Bg3 {White asks Black to trade off the dark-squared Bishops. Black would be better off not to do this as in the long run White's pair of Knights would be much better than Black's
moribund light-squared Bishop and the Knight on f6}

12...Bxg3 {Is this a mistake to exchange the active Bishop for the inactive one? Only time will tell.}

13.Nxg3 {13.hxg3 is the top engine recommendation.
But having an open h-file  after self-inflicted doubled g2 and g3 pawns is beyond comprehension}

13...h5 {Black's idea is to play ...h4 and kick away the Knight. Then Black will play ...h3 and create a "thorn" pawn.
In this case White will have to push g3 to keep the g-file closed. But this allows the Black pawn on h3
unhindered stay creating long-term problems for White. This thorn pawn formation is a favourite of chess engines like Stockfish and neural network
behemoth like Alphazero}

14.h3 {White does not want Black to play ...h3 at any cost and hence occupies the h3 square himself. 14.O-O would be a mistake as Black can then create the thorn pawn as follows: 14...h4 15.Ne2 h3 16.g3 with an unclear position}

14...h4 {Black gains more space on the h-file and attacks the Knight}

15.Nge2 {15.Nf1 Qd6! is a resourceful move that threatens ...Qxd4 and Black has sufficient counterplay}

15...Nh5 {Vacating the g5 square for the Queen as Black wants to launch a Kingside counter-offensive. After ...Qg5, ...Bf5 becomes a possibility}

16.O-O {White takes the King to safety}

16...Qg5 {Threatening ...Bxh3. Black turns up the pressure}

17.Kh2 {the h3 pawn is now unpinned. 17.Kh1 is also okay}

17...Bf5 {Development with a tempo on the White Queen}

18.Qd2 {18.Qa4 looks to be a mouth-watering prospect with a double attack on the a6 and c6 pawns. But then 18...Re6 gives Black enough teeth and the Queen has to come back
without munching pawns}

18...Re6 {Black will most probably go ...Rg6 threatening checkmate on g2}

19.Rae1 {19.Rac1 does look good but after 19...Rae8 Black has too much pressure on the e-file.
20.Na4? looks attractive but actually is bad as 20...Rg6 threatening mate on g2 forces White to play 21.Rg1 Bd5 and Black is suddenly active.
The Rook on e1 keeps the c1 square vacant for the Knight on e2 as White can later try for Ne2-c1-b3 or Ne2-c1-d3 depending upon
Black's response. The other Knight on c3 can jump to a4 and White's main idea is to thrust his pieces to hunt down Black's major
weaknesses on a6,a7 and c6}

19...Rae8 {Bringing the last piece into the game. Black does not rush with 19...Rg6 as 20.Rg1 would stop the checkmating idea}

20.b3 {A waiting move as White prepares Na4-c5}

20...a5 {Black too waits. Perhaps a better move was to push 20...Qe7 and then push 21...g5 increasing the pressure on the Kingside}

21.Na4 {Preparing Nc5, the Knight not only wants to gain the outpost but also attacks the a5 pawn in the process.}

21...Rg6  {Threatening mate on g2}

22.Rg1 {Forced}

22...Nf6 {A strange Knight retreat. 22...Qd8 was better as Black's attack on the White King looks dead. Black's Knight in all probability wants to
come to the e4 square}

23.Nc5 {Occupying the hole on c5 with more control over the e4 square. White is ready to trade on e4 if Black were to plant his Knight or Bishop there}

23...a4 {Black wants to gid rid of the doubled pawns and if White plays 24.bxa4 then Black will target the doubled a-pawns later}

24.Nf4 {Attacking the Rook}
24...Rh6 25.b4 {White keeps the structure closed}
25...Ne4 26.Nxe4 Bxe4 {A pair of Knights are exchanged as Black has too many dark square weaknesses}
27.Rc1 {Rc5 is an idea with an intention of occupying the outpost}
27...Qd8{Bringing back the Queen into the game as the attack on the g-file has been stopped}
28.Rc5 {Occupying the outpost}
28...g5  {Attacking the Knight again}
29.Nd3 {29.Ne2 is okay for White as well}
29...Qb8+ 30.Kh1 Qc8 {Threatening Qxh3# on the next move}
31.Kh2 {White King goes back again. In hindsight, 28.Rc5 looks bad now as 28.Rf1 could have vacated the g1 square for the White King}
31...Qb8+ 32.Kh1 {The position has been repeated}
32...Qc8 {Threatening Qxh3# on the next move}
33.f3 {The mate is prevented}
33...Bxf3 {Black plays a series of exchanges that neutralises White's grip on the position.}
34.gxf3 Qxh3+ 35.Qh2 Qxf3+
36.Qg2 Rxe3 37.Qxf3 Rxf3 38.Rxg5+ Kh7  {The position looks drawish}
39.Ne5 Rh3+ 40.Kg2 Ra3 {Attacking the pawn on a2}
41.Nxf7 {The Knight grabs a pawn}
41...Rxa2+ {Draw offered and agreed}1/2/-1/2

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical pawn opening from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit. Here White challenges Black's central pawn and threatens to capture cxd5 and eliminate one of Black's central pawns. Also White can
attain a semi-open c-file for the White Rooks. On the other hand, White is also allowing Black to capture ...dxc4. This gambit is not a true pawn sacrifice White can then
play Qa4+ followed by Qxc4 regaining the pawn}

2...e6 {The QGD or the Queen's gambit declined. Black reinforces the pawn on d5 and will reply cxd5 with exd5}

3.Nc3 {A popular reply where White develops the Knight and adds more pressure on the d5 pawn. Akso, White is now ready to play the move e4 at some point soon}
3...c6 {The Semi-slav. The Slav occurs after the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6. Black is now emphasising the fact that ...dxc4 is possible followed by ...b5 where Black will be a pawn up}

4.e3 {White is ready to play Bxc4 id Black plays ...dxc4 gaining a slight advantage}
4...Nf6 {Black develops a piece and continues development}

5.Nf3 {White can also develop now as the capture ...dxc4 has been averted}
5...Nbd7 {A nice move where Black will most likely played ...Bd6 followed by ...e5. Also ...c5 is an idea in this setup.At this stage we can see Identical pawns structures f2-e3-d4 for White
and f7-e6-d5 for Black. The only difference is that Black's Knight on d7 is less active than its counterpart on c3. Aldo White's pawn on c4 is more active than the pawn on c6.
There is nothing much to choose between the two sides and the position is equal.}

6.b3 {A subtle anti-Meran move order. Here 6.Qc2 is also playable signalling the beginning of the anti-Meran. The Meran variation occurs after White plays
6.Bd3. Then Black continues with the thematic capture of the Semi-Slav 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 8.Be2 Bb7.
 Now Black will look to push ...c5 and gain nice control in the centre. By playing 6.b3 the capture ...dxc4 can then be answered with bxc4 and the light-squared Bishop
 is protected from harassment. Also the f2-e3-d4 pawn structure has ensured that White's Bishop on c1 will remain a bad piece. The move b3 clears the b2 square where the Bishop on c1
 can find a new square and become more effective on a1-h8 diagonal in the future.}

6...Bb4 {An aggressive move by Black. The Bishop attacks the undefended Knight on c3 and forces White to make a decision.}

7.Bd2 {The Bishop is forced to unpin the Knight. 7.Bb2? is bad because Black will win a pawn after 7...Qa5! 8.Qc2 Ne4! attacking the pinned Knight again. 9.Rc1 is forced and then Black can
 play 9...Qxa2 taking advantage of the pin on c3}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

8.Be2 {8.Bd3 looks the more natural square but it allowss Black to play 8...dxc4 9.bxc4 e5 and Black threatens to play ...Bxc3 followed by ...e4 forking the Knight and the Bishop.
To avoid this fork White will have to retract the Bishop by playing Be2 in any case. The variation will run something like this:
8.Bxd3?! dxc4 9.bxc4 e5 10.O-O? Bxc3 11.Bxc3 e4 winning a piece. Look how castling a "normal" developing move on move 10 runs into trouble.}

8...Qe7 {Black usually pepares the control of the centre with ...c5 or ...e5 as the Queen  protects both these squares. Black main ideas here are ...b6,
...Bb7,...Re8 and play ...c5 or ...e5}

9.O-O {White completes the Kingside development}

9...Rd8 {Hard to understand the logic behind this move. 9...Re8 was perhaps much better with Black keeping the option of playing
...e5 later}

10.Qc2 {Controlling the e4 square and connecting the Rooks}

10...dxc4 {Black gives up the centre.In my opinion this is an odd way of playing the anti-Meran }

11.bxc4 {11.Bxc4 allows 11...b5 kicking the Bishop again.}

11...b6 {Looking for ...c5 and ...Bb7}

12.Ne4 {White wants the Bishops to be exchanged}
12...Bxd2 13.Nexd2 Bb7 {Black's now left with both options of pushing ...c5 or ...e5}
14.Rfe1 {White's plan is to play Bd3 and push e4 to gain space in the centre.}

14...c5 {Black plays the freeing move and the Bishop on b7 now breathes fire along the a8-h1 diagonal.The e4 pawn push needs more hard work from White}

15. a4 {White has to change his plan as 15.Bd3 to push e4 looks unattractive at the moment.
The idea of pushing ...Rd8 on move 9 is much clearer now.
15.Bd3 with an idea of pushing allows Black to play 15...Rac8 16.Rac1 Nb8 clearing the Rook's control over the d4 square making e4 impossible.
15.Bd3 Rac6 16.e4? is bad because 16...cxd4 17.Nxd4? Nc5! attacking the Knight and the Bishop on d3 indirectly. White will loose a piece.
White plans to push a5 and then use Black's b6 pawn as a pivot to open up the Queenside files}

15...a5 {Black nips White's plan in the bud}

16.Bd3 {White waits as the Bishop's activity is improved}

16...h6 {A useful waiting move providing some luft to the Black King on the h7 square}

17.Rab1 {White puts more pressure on the backward b6 pawn.Rb3 followed by Qb2 is an idea to create pressure on the b6 pawn}

17...Rac8 {Improving the Queen Rook's position and Black now threatens ...cxd4 and after White replies exd4 then Black would play ...Nd5 taling advantage of the pinned pawn on c4}

18.Qd1 {The Queen goes to the home square to avoid the threat}

18...Re8 {Another waiting move. }

19.e4 {White expands in the centre and sacrifices the d4 pawn for activity}

19...cxd4 {Black grabs the pawn. No other move looks satisfactory for Black as White threatens to push d5 on the next move}

20.e5! {White grabs more space and creates a wedge pawn on the e5 square forcing back the Knight}

20...Nh7 {20...Nh5 was also okay but this move keeps options flexible for Black. This Knight can now go to ...Nf8 followed by ...Ng6 later}

21.Be4 {White wants the dangerous light-squared Bishop on b7 to be neutralised}

21...Bxe4 {Black liquidates. 21...Ba6 misplaces the Bishop and so this move played in the game was satisfactory}

22.Nxe4 {22.Rxe4 allows 22...d3 23.Rd4 Rfe8 24.Rxd3 Nc5 and White's Rook will have to make another move to return back to safety allowing Black to better his position}

22...Red8 {White was threatening Nd6 forking both the Rooks. This move seems the best continuation. 22...Rxc4? 23.Nd6 and the fork will help White
to win the exchange}

23.Qxd4 {White not only regains the pawn but also the Queen is nicely centralised. White has great space advantage but Black is not bad either.}

23...Nhf8 {Black wants to improve the Knight's position by playing ...Nc5 followed by ...Nfd7}

24.h4 {White decides to expand on the Kingside as the Knight and Queen are nicely centralised}

24...Nc5 {Opening up a discovered attack on the Queen and also aiming at the a4 pawn}

25.Nd6 {White blocks with the Knight and hopes to create  another wedge in Black's throat}

25...Rb8 {Black defends the Rook}

26.Rbd1 {White concentrates his energy on the central d-file and not bothering about the pawn on a4}

26...Nxa4 {Black grabs the pawn as the remaining pieces are still passive}

27.Qe3 {Vacating the d4 square for the other Knight. The Rook can also come to d4 followed by Rg4 depending upon Black's response}

27...Nd7 {Bringing the other Knight into the game}

28.g4 {White expands on the Kingside as Black's pieces are stuck}

28...Nac5 {The Knigh retreats back}

29.g5 {White wants to open up the Kingside}

29...h5 {Black keeps the pawn structure closed}

30.Nb5  {31.Rd6 is an idea now as White waits }
30...Na6 31.Nd6 Nac5 32.Nb5 {Draw offered and Black agrees}1/2-1/2

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6{Another popular response is 1...d5.}

2.c4 {Gaining space and also controlling the d5 square. The Knight on b1 can now come to c3 depending on Black's choice of moves.}

2...e6 {Black opens the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop}

3.Nc3 Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence.White's Knight on c3 was protecting the e4 square and White was threatening to gain a massive central pawn mass with e2-e4.The Black Bishop pinnning the Knight on c3
is the beginning of a solid defensive idea for Black. Nimzo-Indian defence is considered to a rock-solid response and many players from the White side tend to avoid it by playing
3.Nf3}

4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation where White does not mind ...Bxc3+ and getting a damaged pawn structure. White main emphasis
is on quick development. This move opens the diagonal for the Bishop on f1}

4...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

5.Bd3 {The e4 square is given more protection and again e2-e4 is threatened}

5...d5 {Stopping ...e4}

6.Nf3 {White wants to castle and complete development}

6...c5 {The threat is ...cxd4 and hence White cannot push e4 again. In this main line Black has an equal stake in the centre}

7.O-O Nc6 {Adding more pressure on the pawn on d4 and preventing e2-e4. This is the standard opening theory}

8.a3 {White can also decide to exchange pawns in the centre with cxd5 and leave Black with a possible isolated pawn that can be targeted later
The well-trodden path is to win the Bishop pair with 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3.
However, White's Bishop pair is offset with the damaged pawn structure}

8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 {White eliminates Black's Bishop pair}

9...Qc7 {The most common continuation Black does not commit to any pawn breaks in the centre}

10.Bb2 {White places the Bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal and wants to play cxd5 followed by c4 to activate the dark-squared Bishop}

10...dxc4 {Black could also have played 10...Na5 forcing White to play 11.cxd5}

11.Bxc4 {White now has the Bishop pair but Black is not too bad either}

11...e5 {Putting more pressure on the d4 pawn and clearing the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8}

12.h3 {...Bg4 is an annoying pin that White prevents}

12...Bf5 {Black develops the last remaining Bishop and connects Rooks}

13.Bb5 {Attacking the defender of the e5 pawn forcing Black to take a decision over the e5 pawn}

13...e4 {Black pushes the pawn and fixes it on e4 attacking the White Knight}

14.Nd2 {The Knight comes back on to a safe square. 14.Nh4 Bc8 and the Knight looks stupid on the h4 square}

14...Rad8 {Hard to say whether 14...Rfd8 was much better. It is a tricky decision to make on many occassions}

15.Re1 {Improving the Rook's position}

15...Rfe8 {Black also follows White and activates the other Rook.Perhaps 15...Rd6 followed by ...Rfd8 was a better option as Black could have kept up the
pressure on the d-file}

16.Rc1 {Activating the other Rook}

16...Re6 {Unpinning the Knight on c6.It is time to take stock of the situation. White's Bishop on b2 is not doing anthing great. The Bishop on b5 is also hitting wood.
Once the c-file opens up then White's Rook on c1 will have something to look forward too. Black Rooks can double up on the d-file and create some pressure.
Black's Knights and the Bishop are also passive. }

17.Bf1 {White retreats the Bishop and the plan is to target the pawn on e4 via moves like g3,Bg2,Qc2.}

17...b6 {Black plays another waiting move.17...Red6 was perhaps a better option which would have put more pressure on the d-file}

18.a4 {White wants to activate the Bishop on b2 with the intention of playing Ba3 soon}

18...h6 {Another waiting move 18...Red6 was better in terms of proactiveness}

19.Ba3 {White's Bishop is now on a nice diagonal}

19...Na5 {It is hard to interpret such esoteric moves. Perhaps the Knight wants to go to b7.But Why?}

20.Nc4 {White decides to ease the cramp in his position by offering an exchange of Knights}

20...Nxc4 {Black accepts}

21.Bxc4 Rc6 {Increasing the pressure on the c-file}

22.Bb5 {Attacking the Rook and disloging its presence from the c-file}

22...Rcd6 {The Rook goes back}

23.a5 {Whitee wants to exchange pawns and simplify further}

23...Be6 {Improving the Bishop's influence}

24.Qe2 {The Queen gets out of the d-file}

24...Bxh3!? {I must admit this came out of the blue. Black wants to open up the h and g-files and launch an attack against the White King}

25.gxh3 {White has to accept the sacrifice or else the Bishop retreats and Black will be a pawn up for nothing.}

25...Rd5 {Threatening not only ...Rg5+ but also cxd4 and attacking the Bishop on b5}

26.Qb2 {Vacating the e2 square for the King to escape. If the Rook checks on g5 then Kf1 is the way to go.
Also the Bishop on b5 is protected now and both the threats of Black have been parried}

26...Qc8!? {Very nice. Black prevents White from escaping with the King on to the Queenside. Threatening ...Qxh3 with disastrous consequences
27.Kf1 is ruled out}

27.Bf1 {Forced as White cannot afford the infiltration of the Black Queen. Now the King remains stuck on g1 and Black can continue
with the aggression}
27...Rg5+ {Forcing the King on the h-file}
28.Kh2 {28.Kh1 loses instantly.}
28...Ng4+!! {Very nice}
29.Kh1 {The King is cornered}
29...Qf5! {Bringing the Queen into the game}
30.Rc2 {Protecting the f2 pawn}
30...Rd6!! {Black brings the last piece into the attack and ...Rg6 is on the cards}
31.Bg2 {What else?}
31...Ne5 {Who cares about the Knight when mate is on the horizon? ...Rg6 is next on the cards}
32.dxe5* {White will lose soon as ...Rg6 cannot be averted}
32...Rdg6 {The Bishop on g2 looks a dead piece} 33.f4 {What else ?}
33...exf3 34.h4 {Attacking the Rook as White plays few more moves before the end}
34...Rg4
35.Kg1 Rxh4 {The Rooks are zeroing on the White King like vultures}
36.e6 Qh3 {The threat is ...Qh1+ followed by ...Qxg2.White resigned as the King will be checkmated}0-1

1.e4 e6 {The French defence is on the board. The move ...e6 is a preparatory move to play ...d5 and challenge White's central control.}

2.d4 {White's natural response. When presented with an opportunity to gain advantage over the central squares go for it! White plants both his pawns on central squares
and controls c5,d5,e5 and f5 squares in Black's camp.}

2...d5 {Black thrusts his pawn in the centre and challenges White's central control. As we can see Black has created a light-squared pawn
chain on the d5 and e6 squares. Black's deep idea is based on the fact that White will have to alter
the pawn structure in the centre.By playing ...d5 Black is also attacking the pawn on e4 and threatening ...dxe4. White will have to react to this threat. }

3.Nc3 {A good response considered to be the "best" choice for White. White not only develops a piece but also is ready to respond with 4.Nxe4 if Black were to play 3...dxe4
3.Nd2 is called the Tarrasch variation while 3.e5 is the advanced variation both leading to slow positional struggles}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation. Black's response is radical because Black by playing ...e6 and ...d5 has rendered the Bishop on c8 weak.
The move played pins the White Knight on c3 and renews the  threat of ...dxe4. Black is also ready to exchange the Bishop for the Knight
by playing ...Bxc3+ and give White doubled pawns on the c-file after
White replies with bxc3.
Black also wants to play ...b6 followed by ...Ba6 to exchange his problem Bishop or Black can also play ...Bd7-e8-g6 in some lines.
This however, allows White a great counter-advantage as White can exert great pressure on the Kingside by playing Qg4 and attacking the pawn on g7}

4.e5 {White's usual response. Now White has altered the pawn structure and created a dark-squared pawn chain on the d4 and e5 squares. Black's main ideas now revolve
around by developing pieces and pawns to attack this pawn chain's base on the d4 square followed by ...f6 later to attack the pawn spearhead on the e5 square.}

4...c5 {Black gets his own stake in the centre}

5.a3 {The main line continuation to grab the Bishop pair}

5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 {White gets doubled pawns as a downside to the Bishop pair.Black on the other hand is weak on the dark squares as the Bishop is exchanged}

6...Qa5!? {The Portisch-Hook variation as it is known}

7.Bd2 {The best defence}

7...Qa4 {The main idea of this Queen sortie is to attack the pawns on d4 and c2. White's dangerous motif in this variation is to play Qg4 and threaten the pawn on g7.Byt playing the move ...Qa4 Black hopes to prevent White from executing the plan}

8.Qg4!? {An ambitious move where the pawn on d4 is protected but the pawn on c2 is left as a gambit. White Queen is willing to damage Black's Kingside with Qxg7}

8...Kf8!? {The Black King protects the dark squares!. This idea though makes castling impossible.Now ...Qxc2 is in the air}

9.h4?! {Not a good move. White believes that the Black King can simply be checkmated soon.9.Nf3 was more accurate.}

9...Ne7 {Black's idea is to play ...Qxc2 followed by ...Qg6 to neutralise White's attacking chances. The Knight on e7 also prepares to capture ...Nxg6 if White trades Queens with Qxg6}

10.h5?! {White pushes the pawn forward with possible ideas like Rh1-h3-g3.}

10...h6 {It is necessary to halt the pawn march. 10...Nbc6?! is a bad choice as it allows White to play 11.h6!
Now Black cannot play 11...g6? as this leaves the f6-g7 squares as glaring holes for White to
exploit. 12.Qf4 and with moves like Ng1-f3-g5 threatening Qf7# Black will be in a bad shape.
Also 10...Nbc6?! 11.h6! gxh6 12.Nf3 Qxc2 with the idea of retreating to g6 also does not give Black a comfortable game.
13.Rc1 Qg6 14.Bxh6+! Ke8 15.Qf4 and Black is playing a tough game to survive}

11.Rh3!? {White wants to attack with the Queen-Rook battery on the f7 or g7 square depending upon Black's response. White wants check-mate at any cost! }

11...Nbc6 {Developing the Knight which can go to d8 and protect the f7 square if required}

12.Qf4 {The next move is probably Rf3 threatening mate on f7!}

12...Qxc2 {Another Queen move to capture a pawn!
Black could also have played 12...c4 to keep the centre closed and also hinder the activity of White's Bishop on f1.
Since White has already made another Queen move in order to
mate the Black King, it seems prudent to capture the pawn on c2 now.}

13.Bd3 {Developing the Bishop and attacking the Queen}

13...Qa4 {The Queen retreats on the only safe square available}

14.Rg3 {Not the best continuation. 14.Rf3 was better where Black would have been left with the only option 14...Nd8 to avoid checkmate}

14...Nf5 {Attacking the Rook on g3 and defending the pawn on g7 simultaneously. White's Rook has to waste a precious tempo now}

15.Rf3 {Protecting the Rook and threatens g4 followed by Qxf7# after Black moves the Knight on f5}

15...Nd8 {Forced to protect the f7 square as Black prepares to meet g4}

16.Ne2!? {An excellent move defending the pawn on d4. There is no need for g4 as Black has the f7 square covered}

16...b6 {Black wants to neutralise White's strong Bishop on d3. ...Ba6 is the idea. The move also adds more protection to the pawn on c5}

17.c4 {Good move. White attacks the d5 pawn and threatens to capture cxd5 and put added pressure on the e6 pawn. The c3 square is also vacated for the Knight
to join the party}

17...Bb7 {More or less forced as Black cannot afford the collapse of the pawn chain. The Bishop supports the pawn on d5. The Knight on f5 has lost one of its defenders and White
can regain her pawn back. 17...Ba6? 18.cxd5 Bxd3 19.Rxd3 Qc4 supporting the pawn on c5 and e6, allows White to play 20. Qf3 Qxd5 21.Qxd5 exd5 22.dxc5 and the pawn on d5
will also be lost soon giving White a healthy advantage}

18.Bxf5 {White grabs the Knight and decides to get back a pawn for material parity. 18.cxd5 Nxd4 19.Nxd4 Qxd4 is okay for Black }

18...exf5 19.Qxf5 {The pressure on f7 is incessant}

19...Kg8 {Black is stuck with passive defence as of now as White threatens Rg3 and Qg4 next. White threatened to push e6 and pin the f7 pawn. The King
move makes this threat less attractive. 19...Qe8 allows 20.cxd5 Bxd5 21.Rg3 and with the threat of Qg4 Black will have to play the
passive ...Rh7 and it will take some effort to re-activate this Rook later in the game}

20.e6!? {Nice move. White intends to open up the e-file and keep up the pressure}

20...fxe6 {Black needs to accept the wedge pawn as 21.exf7 is threatened ripping apart the pawn structure}

21.Qg4 {Keeping the pressure on the g7 pawn and Black has a difficult defense ahead}

21...Ba6 {Attacking the pawn on c4. This is a delicate position for Black}

22.Rg3 {Threatening mate on g7}

22...Rh7 {An ugly move but necessary to stave off mate. 22...Qd7?! is bad as White crashes throught the centre.
23.cxd5 taking advantage of the pinned pawn on d5. 23...Rh7 24.dxc5 Qxd5 and Black is looking really passive}

23.cxd5 {White goes for the absolute best continuation. 23.dxc5 bxc5 24.cxd5 is not good as Black gets away with 24...Qxg4
23.Rc1?! is bad as 23...Bxc4 allows Black to make a comeback}

23...exd5 {23...Bxe2 24.Qxe2 Qxd4? allows White to bust open Black. 25.Bc3! Qxd5 26.Rd1 and Black will go downhill after 26...Qb7 27.Rgd3 Nf7 28.Qxe6 winning}

24.Re3!! {Outstanding. The e-file is cut-off from the King and the e8 square is unavailable for the Queen now.}
24...Nf7 {Forced as Black's Rook on a8 needs to be brought out for defence}
25.Rc1 Rf8 {The last piece into the act}
26.Qe6 {A fine move to cut off the Black Knight}
26...cxd4 {Attacking the Rook after grabbing the central pawn}
27.Re5 {Attacking the d5 pawn}
27...Qxa3 {27...Bxe2 will be a mistake as 28.Rxe2 allows White to have unrestricted control over the c8 square with Rc8 on the cards}
28.Rxd5 {Destroying Black's centre}
28...Qa4 {Black wants to get back to the e8 square.28...Qa2 29.Rc7 Bc4 30.Rxf7 Qb1+ 31.Bc1 Bxd5 32.Rxf8+ Kxf8 33.Qxd5 and White is winning}
29.Re5 {Blocking ...Qe8 move}
29...Kh8 {The Knight is unpinned and the Rook on e5 is under attack. The Rook on h7 is totally out of the game and Black is technically a Rook down}
30.Re4 {White maintains the pressure on the e8 square and also turns his attention to the d4 pawn.Rc7 is also on the cards.}
30...Qa3 {30...Ng5 looks like Black will win the exchange after forking White's Queen and Rook. But 31.Qd6!! spoils the party as Qxf8# is threatened.
The Queen move from Black guards the d6 square and Black threatens ...Ng5 to fork the heavy pieces on e4 and e6.White
does not have the option of Qd6 as discussed earlier to prevent the fork.}
31.Nf4 {White does not fall for the trap but instead goes hunting for the g6 square forcing another King move}
31...Kg8 {Forced as Ng6+ ends the game for Black. The Knight on f7 is again a pinned piece while the Rook on h7 looks a dead piece}
32.f3 {Another waiting move as White plays a python like squeezing move}
32...Qd6 {Looking to trade Queens}
33.Qb3 {Threatening 35.Bb4 with a winning position}
33...Qd7 {The Queen gets out of the way but Black is looking tight here}
34.Nd5 {White plans to go Ne7-g6 followed by Nxf8 } 34...Kh8 {Black is staring at defeat here }
35.Ne7 {Ng6 is inevitable here}
35...g5 {Black is prolonging the inevitable}
36.Ng6+ Kg7 {The Rook on h7 can look forward to have something active}
37.Nxf8 Kxf8 {Black loses the exchange and it is game over}
38.Bb4+ Kg8 {The King is put back as White tightens the screws}
39.Rc7!! {The Rook is acting as a sacrificial goat to get to the Black King. }
39...Qb5 {Looking for 40...Qe2# as 39...Qxc7?? 40.Re8+ Kg7 41.Bf8+ Kf6 42.Qe6#}
40.Kf2 {Forced} Rg7 {What else?} 41.Rxd4 {Black Resigned. 12...Qxc2,in hindsight, seems a mistake now!}1-0
