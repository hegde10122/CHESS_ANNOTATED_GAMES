1.d4 Nf6 {The Queen's pawn opening is answered by the flexible Knight move controlling the e4 square. Here Black does not commit his pawn structure and has a
variety of options to choose from. }

2.c4 {The best move as White controls the d5 square and gains space. The Knight on b1 can now go to c3 and control the e4 and d5 squares}

2...e6 {The move controls the d5 square and opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop on f8.Black can also play ...d5 and stake a claim to the central
e4 and c4 squares}

3.Nc3 {White develops the Queen's Knight to the best square and adds more control over the e4 and d5 squares. White wants to push e4 soon and have a massive centre.}

3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence named after its creator Aron Nimzowitsch, a leading Danish-Russian chess master who was a pioneer of the hypermodern chess theory.
The Knight on c3 is pinned and has no control over the e4 and d5 squares. Here Black develops a piece and is looking to castle on the next move. In most cases, the Bishop
on b4 will be exchanged for the Knight after ...Bxc3. Black hopes to strike at the centre later owing to his much more active development.}

4.e3* {The Rubinstein variation named after Akiba Rubinstein a well-known Polish Grandmaster. Rubinstein encyclopedic knowledge of chess endgames is legendary.
Here White neglects the threat of ...Bxc3+ and proceeds to activate the Bishop on f1. White wants to
develop soon and later on carry on a positional struggle in the centre. The downside of this move is that the
Bishop on c1 gets locked-in and White will have to do extra to activate it.}

1.e4 {White's pawn opening is considered to be the best and has been the oldest opening move in recorded chess history}

1...e6  {The French defence where Black will challenge the centre with ...d5}

2.d4 d5* {White occupies the central squares while Black hits back with the control of the c4 and e4 squares.Black has created a light-square pawn complex but the
downside is that the Bishop on c8 may take time to activate}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation in which White reinforces his support to the e4 pawn by developing the Queen's Knight. 3.e5 leads to the advanced variation while
3.Nd2 is called the Tarassch variation}

3...Bb4* {The Winawer variation where the Bishop on b4 pins the Knight and threatens to capture ...dxe4 and win a central pawn}

1.d4 Nf6  {The Indian defence}

2.Bg5 {The Trompowsky attack. Here White wants to damage Black's pawn structure after Bxf6 and carry out a blistering attack on the weakened Kingside}

2...c5 {A theoretical move. Black hits back in the centre and challenges the pawn on d4. Black is not afraid of the Knight capture and the damage to the pawn structure}

3.Bxf6 {White gives up the Bishop pair and goes ahead with the plan. 3.d5 or 3.Nc3 is also considered playable for White}

3...exf6 {Capturing away from the centre opens the e7 square for the Bishop and Black can still O-O activating the Rook on h8. 3...gxf6 is also playable. In that case
the g-file will be available for the Rook on g8 for active counterplay. But the downside is that Black's King might remain stuck in the centre or will have to O-O-O in order to be safe}

4.Nc3 {As White has already made his intentions clear to carry out an offensive against Black, quick development is necessary. }

4...d5 {Black occupies the central d5 square with his pawn and does not allow White to gain space by pushing the pawn on d4 to d5.The move also allows the Bishop on c8 to develop.
It is important for Black to proceed for active development of his pieces. Active development is always the best defence}

5. e3 {The pawn on d4 is reinforced and the Bishop on f1 is now ready to fly! Way to go White!}

5...Be6* {The Queen's Bishop is developed. A fair question would be why on the e6 square and not the f5 square where the Bishop controls more squares? It is because 
if 5...Bf5 then White can play 6.dxc5 Bxc5 7.Qxd5 and win a pawn.The Bishop on e6 is now guarding the pawn on d5.Remember a natural looking move like ...Bf5 will allow White
to carry out his attack as Black cannot afford to loose a central pawn and open files for the White pieces.}
