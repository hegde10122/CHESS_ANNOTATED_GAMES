1.d4 Nf6 {The Queen's pawn opening is answered by the flexible Knight move controlling the e4 square. Here Black does not commit his pawn structure and has a
variety of options to choose from. }

2.c4 {The best move as White controls the d5 square and gains space. The Knight on b1 can now go to c3 and control the e4 and d5 squares}

2...e6 {The move controls the d5 square and opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop on f8.Black can also play ...d5 and stake a claim to the central
e4 and c4 squares}

3.Nc3 {White develops the Queen's Knight to the best square and adds more control over the e4 and d5 squares. White wants to push e4 soon and have a massive centre.}

3...Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence named after its creator Aron Nimzowitsch, a leading Danish-Russian chess master who was a pioneer of the hypermodern chess theory.
The Knight on c3 is pinned and has no control over the e4 and d5 squares. Here Black develops a piece and is looking to castle on the next move. In most cases, the Bishop
on b4 will be exchanged for the Knight after ...Bxc3. Black hopes to strike at the centre later owing to his much more active development.}

4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation named after Akiba Rubinstein a well-known Polish Grandmaster. Rubinstein encyclopedic knowledge of chess endgames is legendary.
Here White neglects the threat of ...Bxc3+ and proceeds to activate the Bishop on f1. White wants to
develop soon and later on carry on a positional struggle in the centre. The downside of this move is that the
Bishop on c1 gets locked-in and White will have to do extra to activate it.}

4...b6 {A great choice from Black where he is looking to fianchetto the light-squared bishop to b7. Another annoying move is to play ...Ba6 and attack the pawn on c4 if White were to slip up
4...c5 or 4...d5 are the other common choices.This move introduces the Fischer variation in the Nimzo-indian}

5.Bd3 {White gets on with the development of the Kingside - a key motif in this variation of the Nimzo-Indian}

5...Bb7 {5...O-O is also an alternative for Black}

6.Nf3 O-O {Development for both the parties}

7.O-O c5 {All standard theory in this variation so far. Black is now challenging White's central control.Black stops White from pushing e4 as of now}

8.Na4 {White now aims to get Black's Bishop to move to a5 where it's value will be decreased.White wants to play 9.dxc5 and get the Bishop after Black recaptures ...Bxc5}

8...cxd4 {Black clears the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop as he anticipates White's pawn push a3 anytime soon}

9.a3 {White does not recapture the pawn but attacks the Bishop}

9...Bd6 {9...Be7 is the move preferred by many masters which I feel is better than the move played by Black in the game. The Bishop on d6 blocks the pawn advance d7-d6 or d7-d5 which will be Black's aim to get hold in the centre}

10.exd4 {10.Nxd4 is a passive recapture that allows Black to play 10...Nc6 11.b4 Ne5 12.Be2 Re8 and Black has more pressure on the c4 pawn}

10...Bxf3 {Black gives up the Bishop pair and aims to play in the centre}

11.Qxf3 Nc6 {The Rook on a8 was attacked and this move not only attacks the pawn on d4 but also blocks the Queen's vigil from f3}

12.Be3 {Protecting the pawn on d4.The position is equal}

12...e5 {This pawn push was the idea behind 9...Bd6. The d4 pawn is attacked again6gb  leaqding to sharp play}

13.dxe5 Nxe5 {Attacking the Queen}
14.Qd1 {The Queen goes back to the starting square}

14...Nxd3 {Black snatches the Bishop and goes for simplification}

15.Qxd3 {Attacking the Bishop on d6}

15...Qc7 {The Queen-Bishop battery is now eyeing the pawn on h2 and threatening ...Bxh2+}

16.h3 {16.g3 is also okay}

16...Rfe8 {Rook belongs to the semi-open file}

17.Rad1 {The Queen-Rook battery now attack the Bishop on d6 }

17...Re6 {Protects the Bishop and willing to play ...Rae8 to increase the influence on the e-file}

18.Nc3 {Intending to play Nb5 next forking the Bishop and the Queen} 

18...Rae8?! {Doubling the Rooks on the e-file but how come Black did not see the fork coming on b5?}

19.Nb5* {The Bishop on d6 is attacked for the third time. What can Black do to save it?}

1.e4 {White's pawn opening is considered to be the best and has been the oldest opening move in recorded chess history}

1...e6  {The French defence where Black will challenge the centre with ...d5}

2.d4 d5 {White occupies the central squares while Black hits back with the control of the c4 and e4 squares.Black has created a light-square pawn complex but the
downside is that the Bishop on c8 may take time to activate}

3.Nc3 {The classical variation in which White reinforces his support to the e4 pawn by developing the Queen's Knight. 3.e5 leads to the advanced variation while
3.Nd2 is called the Tarassch variation}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation where the Bishop on b4 pins the Knight and threatens to capture ...dxe4 and win a central pawn}

4.e5 {The most popular response in accordance with standard theory. White fixes the dark-pawn chain complex in the centre and grabs more space}

4...c5 {Black too aims to have his share of pawns in the centre. Black attacks White central d-pawn with his flank pawn push ...c5}

5.a3 Bxc3+ {Black gives up the Bishop pair} 

6.bxc3 Qa5!?  {The Portisch-Hook variation as it is called.Black's Queen attacks the pawn on c3 and prevents White from developing quickly}

7.Bd2 Qa4 {The Queen now attacks the pawn on d4. More importantly, the Queen keeps an eye on the c2 pawn. White's Qg4 is a common idea in these Winawer variations. The Black Queen can afford to make another move as these nuances will make White think hard.}

8.Qg4!? {The White Queen also plays along and attacks the pawn on g7. The pawn on c2 is kept hanging.}

8...g6 {The dark-squares f6 and h6 are weakened by this move but Black aims to stop White's counterplay.
8...Kf8!? is also a modern-day idea wherein the Black King protects the dark squares! Whith ...g6 Black has kept his options of playing O-O-O later intact.}

9.Nf3 {White persists with the gambit pawn on c2 and hopes to play Ng5,Qf4 and attack the pawn on f7. This makes sense as the Bishop on c8 
is hindered and the Black Queen is sitting on a4}

9...h6 {9...Nc6 is the recommended move according to theory and practice. The idea here is to meet 10.Ng5 with 10...Nd8. White's goal is to infiltrate the Kingside with the Queen and the Knight.
Black deviates from theory and has snuffed out the Ng5 option. In the process Black is lagging behind in development.}

10.Bd3 {White perhaps should have tried 10.Be2 as the Bishop on d3 will have to go back as we shall see}

10...c4 {Black closes the centre and kicks the Bishop}

11.Be2 {11.Bxg6 fxg6 12.Qxg6+ Kf8 is okay for Black as White's Rooks are still on their home squares}

11...Nc6 {No more pawn moves!}

12.Ra2 {White could have continued his aggressive intentions by playing 12.O-O The Rook support to the pawn on c2 looks timid in 
comparison.}

12...Bd7 {Black wants to play O-O-O next and neutralise White's Kingside aggression}

13.Qh4 {Another Queen move to prevent Black from castling long by controlling the d8 square! A better alternative is 13.O-O}

13...Nge7* {Blocking the d8 square from the Queen's glare and prepares O-O-O}

1.d4 Nf6  {The Indian defence}

2.Bg5 {The Trompowsky attack. Here White wants to damage Black's pawn structure after Bxf6 and carry out a blistering attack on the weakened Kingside}

2...c5 {A theoretical move. Black hits back in the centre and challenges the pawn on d4. Black is not afraid of the Knight capture and the damage to the pawn structure}

3.Bxf6 {White gives up the Bishop pair and goes ahead with the plan. 3.d5 or 3.Nc3 is also considered playable for White}

3...exf6 {Capturing away from the centre opens the e7 square for the Bishop and Black can still O-O activating the Rook on h8. 3...gxf6 is also playable. In that case
the g-file will be available for the Rook on g8 for active counterplay. But the downside is that Black's King might remain stuck in the centre or will have to O-O-O in order to be safe}

4.Nc3 {As White has already made his intentions clear to carry out an offensive against Black, quick development is necessary. }

4...d5 {Black occupies the central d5 square with his pawn and does not allow White to gain space by pushing the pawn on d4 to d5.The move also allows the Bishop on c8 to develop.
It is important for Black to proceed for active development of his pieces. Active development is always the best defence}

5. e3 {The pawn on d4 is reinforced and the Bishop on f1 is now ready to fly! Way to go White!}

5...Be6 {The Queen's Bishop is developed. A fair question would be why on the e6 square and not the f5 square where the Bishop controls more squares? It is because
if 5...Bf5 then White can play 6.dxc5 Bxc5 7.Qxd5 and win a pawn.The Bishop on e6 is now guarding the pawn on d5.Remember a natural looking move like ...Bf5 will allow White
to carry out his attack as Black cannot afford to loose a central pawn and open files for the White pieces.}

6.Nge2 {White develops the Knight but blocks the light-squared Bishop on f1. A much better alternative in my opinion was 6.Nf3
White needs to develop rapidly without losing too many tempi to justify giving up the Bishop pair}

6...Nc6 {More development for Black}

7.g3 {White also wants to develop the Bishop and castle soon.White could have also played 7.Qd2 followed by O-O-O}

7...cxd4 {Black alters the pawn structure and clears the c-file for the Rook on a8}

8.exd4 {8.Nxd4 is also possible.}

8...Bb4 {More active development for Black}

9.Bg2 O-O {Both sides develop pieces}

10.O-O Rc8 {Bringing the Rook to a nice semi-open diagonal.Simple chess}

11.a3 {White wants to win the Bishop pair by putting the question to the Bishop}

11...Ba5 {Black retreats back with the Bishop and keeps the Bishop pair.
11...Bxc3 is not attractive as 12.Nxc3 does give Black any good compensation for the relinquished 
Bishop pair}

12.Nf4 {Attacking the pawn on d5 with the third piece}

12...Bxc3 {Eliminating one of the attackers and damaging the pawn structure in the process}

13.bxc3 Na5 {Looking to play ...Nc4 and land the Knight on an outpost}

14.Nxe6 fxe6 {White eliminates the other Bishop too but this is slightly erroneous as the pawn-structure for Black has improved.
14.Re1 was better that threatened to win the pawn on e6 after the exchange of the White Knight for the Black Bishop on e6}

15.Qd3 {Bad choice to protect the pawn on c3.}

15...f5 {Black wants to exert pressure on the c3 pawn. This prepartory move is to allow Black to play Nc4-d6-e4 and attack the pawn on c3.
Another important point to note - This move vacates the f6 square for the Rook on f8. ...Rf6 can lend support to the backward pawn on e6,if required}

16.f4 {White fixes the pawns on the f-file and vacates the f3 square for the Rook to defend the pawn on c3.Black's pawn on e6 is now backward
Instead of fixing the pawn-structure White could have tried 16.Rfe1 in order to put pressure on the backward e6 pawn}

16...Nc4 {The Knight begins it kourney towards the e4 square. Nc4-d6-e4 is an idea to put pressure on the c3 pawn. Also this move attacks the pawn on c3 which means that the Rook on a1 cannot move immediately.
Thus this means that White has to waste a move and play a4 to save the pawn and relieve the Rook on a1 from baby-sitting duties!}

17.Rfb1 {Understandly White wants to break the shackles and attacks the b7 pawn in an attempt to penerate the seventh rank}

17...Rf7* {Black plans to play ...Rc6,...Rfc7,...Qc8 and create an Alekhine gun on the c-file to grab the c3 pawn}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening.A popular choice that ranks along with 1.e4 called the King pawn opening}

1...Nf6 {A flexible opening move to combat White's opening move. This move is extremely flexible and controls the e4 square}

2.c4 {The best possible move controlling the d5 square}

2...e6 {This move frees the dark-squared Bishop's development and adds more control over the d5 square}

3.Nc3 {The most natural response. White is now ready to push e4 and grab the centre}

3...d5 {Black gets the pawn rolling on the central square and adds more control over the e4 square.The game has transposed into the Queen's gambit declined or the QGD}

4.cxd5 exd5 {The exchange variation of the QGD}

5.Bg5 {Putting pressure on the d5 pawn. This is the Carlsbad variation or the positional variation}

5...c6 {A solid move protecting the pawn on d5. White's main idea here is to make the development of Black's light-squared Bishop difficult and keep pressurising the pawn on d5}

6.Qc2 {Making ...Bf5 difficult for the moment. This is the Reshevsky variation of the QGD}

6...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

7.Bh4 {The Pin on the Knight is maintained}

7...Be7 {Developing the Kingside and also unpinning the Knight}

8.e3 {White begins his Kingside development}

8...O-O {Black has nicely played so far}

9.Bd3 {Creating the Bishop-Queen battery on the b1-h7 diagonal}

9...Re8 {The Rook is on a semi-open file. Good chess}

10.Nge2 {White does not want ...Bg4 and also keeps the options of playing f4 or Nf4 later in the game}

10...b6 {The light-squared Bishop will probably come to a6 or b7}

11.O-O {White too completes his Kingside development and the position is equal}

11...Ba6!? {A nice idea to exchange the light-squared Bishops. White has been playing so far with an attempt to make the life of the Bishop on c8 hard but
Black wants to terminate this problem for good}

12.Bf5 {White does not want to trade the Bishops to be consistent with his plan so far}

12...Nh5 {Black looks to trade the dark-squared Bishops.But I feel Black could have played 12...Bc8 and tried to exchange the Bishops of
lighter colours. Black's pawns are currently fixed on light squares and trading the dark-squared Bishops seems to be a positional error
12...Nbd7 was also playable with an intention of playing ...Nf8 and strengthening the Kingside. Also the Knight on h5 does not have anything concrete to do later and will have to retreat back to f6 wasting another tempo}

13.Bxe7 {White happily trades the inactive Bishop for his active counterpart}

13...Qxe7 {Correct recapture. 13...Rxe7 blocks the Queen on d8 and Black will have to waste another tempo to activate the Queen}

14.Rfe1 {The Knight on e2 is unpinned now and White exerts control of his own on the e-file. White is now aiming to play Ng3 followed by e4 with a sound game.}

14...Bb7  {A strange move. The Bishop goes to the worst possible square where the pawns on c6 and d5 obstruct its activity. Perhaps 
Black wants to play ...Na6. 14...Nd7 looks much better.}

15.a3 {White prepares the Queen-side expansion with b4 to follow}

15...Nf6 {The Knight comes back to control the e4 square}

16.b4 {White pushes the pawn in a quest to expand on the Queenside}

16...Nbd7 {The Knight is developed connecting the Rooks}

17.Nf4{
Before White commits his a or b-pawn further, this Knight jump adds an attacker on the d5 pawn making Black's push of c5 harder.
17.Qb3 is also another idea - As White cannot push a4 immediately because the pawn on b4 will be lost after ....Qxb4. 
This Queen move supports the pawn on b4 and now White can push a4 and b5 according to plan of Queenside expansion. 
The Queen on b3 also adds more pressure on the d5 pawn. White can also play Nf4 later bringing a thrd attacker to the d5 pawn disallowing Black from play ..c5 and improving 
the position of the Bishop on b7 and gaining space in the centre}

17...Qd6 {The Queen adds more protection to the pawn on d5}

18.Qb3 {The Queen not only protects the b5 advance but also eyes the d5 square making it harder for Black to achieve the pawn push ...c5}

18...a5 {Challenging the pawn on b4}

19.h3 {White waits as it is not clear whether Black will push ...b5 or capture ...axb4}

19...axb4 {Black releases the tension and opens up the a-file}

20.axb4 {White recaptures and the a-file is now opened up for an exchange of Rooks}

20...Reb8 {Black brings the Rook to assist the action on the Queenside}

21.Nd3 {The Knight position is improved and the Knight can go to e5 later to add pressure on the backward c6 pawn }

21...Nf8* {The Knight will probably come to e6}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening.}

1...Nf6 {A hypermodern approach where Black controls the e4 and d5 squares with a piece. The pawn choices remain flexible depending on White's response}

2.c4 {The best move where White gains more space in the centre by exerting more control over the d5 square}

2...g6 {The King's Indian defence or the Grunfeld defence looks to be Black's choice of countering White's approach. Here Black will bring out the dark-squared
Bishop on f8 and control the a1-h8 diagonal.Black's emphasis is to develop activelyu and then counter-attack White's central control}

3.f3!? {A nice move. This moves serves three purposes. (a) Black could have responded with 3...d5 if White had played 3.Nc3 and challenged the centre immediately. This is the aggressive Grunfeld
defence giving Black great fighting chances. Although White has a great number of choices to counter this defence and obtain an advantage. By playing the text move White has killed 3...d5 as the Grunfeld reply lacks punch after
4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4!. Here White gains a  lot of space and the pawn on e4 is ably supported by his comrade on f3.
(b) The pawn on f3 eliminates the move ...Ng4 or ...Bg4 as of now limiting squares for Black's pieces.White can also prepare moves like g4 followed by h4 to get a pawn storm going and attack the Black Kingside
(c) White delays the move Nc3. The Queen's Knight on b1 can go to a3 or d2 depending upon Black's choices. White's idea will be to play O-O-O in an ideal situation followed by a King side attack.
Moves like Be3,Qd2,Nd2 and O-O-O are on the cards.}

3...d5 {Black sticks with the direct attempt to control the central e4 square with the Queen pawn. The Neo-Grunfeld move}

4.cxd5 Nxd5 {White captures the central pawn with the flank c-pawn and forces Black to recapture}

5.e4 {White grabs the centre with his central pawn duo.}

5...Nb6

6.Nc3 Bg7 {Attacking the pawn on d4}

7.Be3 {Developing the Queenside and also protecting the pawn}

7...O-O {Black castles and commits the King to g8}

8.Qd2 {Looking to plant the dark-squared Bishop on h6 later. O-O-O is now possible as White still lags in development}

8...Nc6 {Adding more pressure on the d4 pawn.8...e5 has also been played here in the spirit of the King's Indian defence}

9.O-O-O {White is now ready to work on the Kingside with a possible assault on the Black King. The d4 pawn is also defended thrice as the Rook on d1 joins the battle}

9...f5!? {Attacking the centre. Since WHite's Kingside development has yet not started, Black takes his opportunity to start his counterplay.}

10.e5 {White smothers the activity of the Bishop on g7 and keeps the centre closed. His main goal is to attain a long-term initiative on the Kingside. Meanwhile, his pieces on the Kingside still need to be developed}

10...Nb4 {The Knight will go back to d5 square which cannot be attacked by White pawns. Black is also looking at a possible plan of a Queenside 
initiative with moves like ...a5,...Be6 and ...Na2+. }

11.Nh3 {The King's Knight is developed controlling the f4 square. It is important that 11.a3 should not be played as it unnecessarily weakens the pawn cover of the White King.}

11...Be6 {Attacking the pawn on a2 with this Bishop development.}

12.Kb1 {The King defends the pawn.12.a3 Na2+ is not desirable for White.}

12...Qd7 {Connecting the Rooks. The Queen can swing over to a4 but currently the White Knight on c3 controls it.}

13.Nf4 {White attacks Black's Bishop on e6. 13.Ng5 also looks a good option to exchange Black's dangerous looking Bishop on e6. 
It was a tough decision to choose between Ng5 and Nf4.13.Ng5 Rfd8 14.h4 with an intention to open up the h-file against the Black King.14...h6 15.Nxe6 Qxe6 
16.Bxh6? allows Black to counterattack.16...c5!? 17.d5 N4xd5 18.Nxd5 Rxd5 and Black looks better}

13...Rfd8* {Sensing more activity on the d5 square, Black improves the position of his King Rook further}

1.d4 Nf6 {The most popular response to the Queen's pawn opening where Black keeps his pawn options open.}
2.c4 e6
3.Nc3 Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence}

4.Qc2 {The classical variation or Capablanca variation wherein White Queen controls the e4 square. 
More importantly, the Queen is also protecting the Knight and will capture Qxc3 after Black trades the dark-squared Bishop for the Knight}

4...Nc6 {The Zurich variation where the Knight attacks the d4 pawn immediately}

5.Nf3 {Adding protection to the pawn. Best continuation as practice suggests}

5...d6 {Black wants to play ...e5 later. This is the preparatory move}

6.Bd2 {The Knight is unpinned and White now threatens to push e2-e4 gaining a great pawn centre. 5.e4 was also possible but then 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 gives White doubled pawns. 6.Qxc3 is not possible as 6...Nxe4 wins a pawn
The whole idea behind 4.Qc2 was to avoid doubled pawns. Hence 5.Bd2 is the more logical continuation}

6...O-O {The Rook can now come to e8 and assist in the pawn push ...e5}

7.a3 {White now gets the Bishop pair - the second key idea in this variation for White.}

7...Bxc3 8.Bxc3 {The e4 square needs Queen's protection so that White can play e2-e4 later. Hence the recapture with the Bishop}

8...Re8 {8...Qe7 is also another good alternative but then 9.e4!? e5 10.d5 Nb8
This is playable for Black but the position is cramped. But now if White decides to pursue a massive centre with 9.e4 then 9...e5 10.d5 allows Black to 
play 10...Ne7 since the e7 square is vacant. This Knight can then jump to g6 or f5 later. Hence I feel that the move 8...Re8 is better than 8...Qe7.Now Black is ready to push ...e5 on the next move}

9.Rd1 {X-raying the Queen and this means Black cannot push ...e5 now. 9...e5? 
10.dxe5 wins a pawn as Black cannot recapture with the pinned pawn on d6.White could have also played 9.O-O-O and brought the 
Rook to d1 but perhaps it is a tad riskier}

9...Bd7* {Black is ready to push ...e5 again as the Bishop on d7 blocks the Queen on d8 from White's Rook }

1.e4 e6 {The French defense.}

4.e5 {The advanced Winawer.}

5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Qa5 {The Portisch-Hook variation where the c3 pawn is attacked followed by ideas explained next.}

7.Bd2 {The best defense}

7...Qa4!? {The Queen move that pressurises the pawn on c2 as well as the pawn on d4. White's main plan is to attack the dark-squared pawn on g7 by playing Qg4 in the advanced Winawer.
But now the c2 pawn will loose support if White wishes to pursue his main idea of controlling the dark-squares.}

8.Qb1 {White threatens Bb5+ winning the Queen on the next move}

8...c4 {Black closes the centre and ensures that White's Bishops are impaired for the time being}

9.Nh3!? {Nice move. Although it looks weird but White's idea is to play Nf4-h5 and then attack the g7 pawn. White wants Black to push g7-g6 
and weaken the dark squares around the King}

9...Nc6 {Black develops the Queen's Knight and prepares ...Bd7 followed by O-O-O.This is the standard plan in this variation for Black}

10.Nf4 {A follow-up to the last move. Attacking the g7 pawn via Nh5 is the idea but Black is comfortable here}

10...Bd7 {Black prepares O-O-O}

11.Be2 {White is ready to castle on the Kingside. A better way to develop the Bishop, in my opinion, was to play g3 and then follow up with Bg2 or Bh3. 
This would have allowed the  light-squared Bishop to eye the Queenside where Black's King in most likelihood will be stationed}

11...O-O-O {Black castles long and aims to push ...f6 followed by ...Rf8 with activity on the Kingside}

12.O-O {White brings out the last piece in to the game and protects the King}

12...f6 {The thematic French pawn break for Black attacking the e5 pawn and looking to open up the f-file}

13.Bg4!? {Attacking the e6 pawn twice instead. 13.exf6 Nxf6 gives Black nice development but White is still okay.}

13...Re8 {13...f5 locks the entire pawn structure and would have made it impossible for Black's pieces to find meaningful squares later}

14.Nh5* {Looks like White wants to keep attacking pawns. The pawn on g7 is now a target. But it is important to note that once Black defends the pawn then the Knight on h5 
will have to go back to find meaningful work which will allow Black to re-group and possibly get a better position.}

1. d4 e6 {1...Nf6 and 1...d5 are more common but the text move is a subtle move-order change avoiding lines of the Trompowsky attack after 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5}
2.c4 Nf6 

3.Nf3 {Avoiding the Nimzo-Indian}

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian defence}

4.Nbd2 {A passive option that aims to win retain the Bishop pair}

4...b6 {Black will fianchetto the other Bishop}

5.a3 {White wants the Bishop pair}

5...Bxd2+ {Black gives up the Bishop pair}

6.Qxd2 {A passive move blocking the dark-squared Bishop.6.Bxd2 is the better move}

6...Bb7 {Controlling the a8-h1 diagonal}

7.e3 {White wants to develop his Kingside now}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development and also brings the Rook into the game} 

8.Be2 {White too intends to O-O soon}

8...a5 {White wants to O-O and play b4 gaining space on the Queenside. White will then follow up with Bb2.This move prevents White 
from pushing b2-b4}

9.b3 {White does not allow Black to push ...a4 which would make the pawn push b2-b3 impossible and throttle his Queenside development}

9...d6 {Prepares ...Nbd7 followed by the pawn push ...e5 or ...c5}

10.Bb2 {A natural follow-up to the last move where the dark-squared Bishop is fianchettoed}

10...Ne4!? {Black occupies the e4 square with a tempo on the White Queen. Black plans to play ...Nbd7,...f5 and a possible ...c5 or ...e5.}

11.Qc2 {The Queen now eyes the Knight and White threatens to cut off the Bishop-Knight combination on e4 with the pawn push d5}

11...Nd7 {More control over the c5 and e5 squares}

12.O-O {White completes his development and connects the Rooks}

12...f5 {Black overprotects the e4 square as White threatens to push d5 soon}

13.d5 {White gains space in the centre and creates a light-square pawn complex on the Queenside squares b3-c4-d5. I feel that this pawn advance is a little premature where White commits his pawn structure.
13.Rad1 looks more flexible where White threatens d5 later.}

13...e5 {Keeping the centre closed and gaining space.Black is now ready to play on the Kingside with moves like ...Rf6,...Rg6 or even ...Ng5}

14.Nd2* {White wants the pesky Knight on e4 to be traded. White also prepares to push f3-f4 or f4 to gain space and make his pieces active}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical response from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's Gambit}

2...e6 {The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is on the board}

3.Nc3 {Developing a piece and putting more pressure on the d5 pawn.}

3...Nf6 {Black protects the d5 pawn further}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {4...Nxd5 is also a playable option that does not allow the annoying pin on g5}

5.Bg5 {The positional variation or the Carlsbad variation where the Knight is pinned and pressure applied on the d5 pawn}

5...c6 {A solid response protecting the pawn on d5.}

6.Qc2 {The Reshevsky variation where the main idea is to make life of the Bishop on c8 difficult. This move robs the f5 square}

6...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

7.Bh4 {Better to keep the pin rather than retreating with Bd2 or Bf4}

7...Bd6 {Black wants to castle soon}

8.e3 {Prepares Bd3 and Kingside development}

8...O-O 9.Bd3 {White develops the Bishop and adds more steel to the b1-h7 diagonal}
9...Re8 {The Rook is developed on the semi-open file considering the fact that White's King is still on the e1 square}

10.Nge2 {White's Knight does not come to the natural f3 square as this allows Black to play ...Bg4. White's main idea here 
is to restrict the development of the Bishop on c8 as much as he can.}

10...Na6 {Black wants to play ...Nb4 and eliminates White's light-squared Bishop.But I feel that this is a hasty move. 10...b6 followed by ...Bb7 or ...Nbd7 was better}

11.Bxa6 bxa6 {White damages the pawn structure and is looking to exploit the doubled a-pawns and the backward c6 pawn in the long run}

12.Bg3 {White asks Black to trade off the dark-squared Bishops. Black would be better off not to do this as in the long run White's pair of Knights would be much better than Black's 
moribund light-squared Bishop and the Knight on f6}

12...Bxg3 {Is this a mistake to exchange the active Bishop for the inactive one? Only time will tell.}

13.Nxg3 {13.hxg3 is the top engine recommendation.
But having an open h-file  after self-inflicted doubled g2 and g3 pawns is beyond comprehension}

13...h5 {Black's idea is to play ...h4 and kick away the Knight. Then Black will play ...h3 and create a "thorn" pawn. 
In this case White will have to push g3 to keep the g-file closed. But this allows the Black pawn on h3 
unhindered stay creating long-term problems for White. This thorn pawn formation is a favourite of chess engines like Stockfish and neural network 
behemoth like Alphazero}
 
14.h3 {White does not want Black to play ...h3 at any cost and hence occupies the h3 square himself. 14.O-O would be a mistake as Black can then create the thorn pawn as follows: 14...h4 15.Ne2 h3 16.g3 with an unclear position}

14...h4 {Black gains more space on the h-file and attacks the Knight}

15.Nge2 {15.Nf1 Qd6! is a resourceful move that threatens ...Qxd4 and Black has sufficient counterplay}

15...Nh5 {Vacating the g5 square for the Queen as Black wants to launch a Kingside counter-offensive. After ...Qg5, ...Bf5 becomes a possibility} 

16.O-O* {White takes the King to safety}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening is equally popular like 1.e4}

1...d5 {Identical pawn opening from Black}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit. Here White challenges Black's central pawn and threatens to capture cxd5 and eliminate one of Black's central pawns. Also White can
attain a semi-open c-file for the White Rooks. On the other hand, White is also allowing Black to capture ...dxc4. This gambit is not a true pawn sacrifice White can then
play Qa4+ followed by Qxc4 regaining the pawn}

2...e6 {The QGD or the Queen's gambit declined. Black reinforces the pawn on d5 and will reply cxd5 with exd5}

3.Nc3 {A popular reply where White develops the Knight and adds more pressure on the d5 pawn. Akso, White is now ready to play the move e4 at some point soon}
3...c6 {The Semi-slav. The Slav occurs after the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6. Black is now emphasising the fact that ...dxc4 is possible followed by ...b5 where Black will be a pawn up}

4.e3 {White is ready to play Bxc4 id Black plays ...dxc4 gaining a slight advantage}
4...Nf6 {Black develops a piece and continues development}

5.Nf3 {White can also develop now as the capture ...dxc4 has been averted}
5...Nbd7 {A nice move where Black will most likely played ...Bd6 followed by ...e5. Also ...c5 is an idea in this setup.At this stage we can see Identical pawns structures f2-e3-d4 for White
and f7-e6-d5 for Black. The only difference is that Black's Knight on d7 is less active than its counterpart on c3. Aldo White's pawn on c4 is more active than the pawn on c6.
There is nothing much to choose between the two sides and the position is equal.}

6.b3 {A subtle anti-Meran move order. Here 6.Qc2 is also playable signalling the beginning of the anti-Meran. The Meran variation occurs after White plays
6.Bd3. Then Black continues with the thematic capture of the Semi-Slav 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5 8.Be2 Bb7.
 Now Black will look to push ...c5 and gain nice control in the centre. By playing 6.b3 the capture ...dxc4 can then be answered with bxc4 and the light-squared Bishop
 is protected from harassment. Also the f2-e3-d4 pawn structure has ensured that White's Bishop on c1 will remain a bad piece. The move b3 clears the b2 square where the Bishop on c1
 can find a new square and become more effective on a1-h8 diagonal in the future.}

6...Bb4 {An aggressive move by Black. The Bishop attacks the undefended Knight on c3 and forces White to make a decision.}

7.Bd2 {The Bishop is forced to unpin the Knight. 7.Bb2? is bad because Black will win a pawn after 7...Qa5! 8.Qc2 Ne4! attacking the pinned Knight again. 9.Rc1 is forced and then Black can
 play 9...Qxa2 taking advantage of the pin on c3}

7...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

8.Be2 {8.Bd3 looks the more natural square but it allowss Black to play 8...dxc4 9.bxc4 e5 and Black threatens to play ...Bxc3 followed by ...e4 forking the Knight and the Bishop.
To avoid this fork White will have to retract the Bishop by playing Be2 in any case. The variation will run something like this:
8.Bxd3?! dxc4 9.bxc4 e5 10.O-O? Bxc3 11.Bxc3 e4 winning a piece. Look how castling a "normal" developing move on move 10 runs into trouble.}

8...Qe7 {Black usually pepares the control of the centre with ...c5 or ...e5 as the Queen  protects both these squares. Black main ideas here are ...b6,
...Bb7,...Re8 and play ...c5 or ...e5}

9.O-O {White completes the Kingside development}

9...Rd8 {Hard to understand the logic behind this move. 9...Re8 was perhaps much better with Black keeping the option of playing 
...e5 later}

10.Qc2 {Controlling the e4 square and connecting the Rooks}

10...dxc4 {Black gives up the centre.In my opinion this is an odd way of playing the anti-Meran }

11.bxc4 {11.Bxc4 allows 11...b5 kicking the Bishop again.}

11...b6 {Looking for ...c5 and ...Bb7}

12.Ne4 {White wants the Bishops to be exchanged}
12...Bxd2 13.Nexd2 Bb7 {Black's now left with both options of pushing ...c5 or ...e5}
14.Rfe1 {White's plan is to play Bd3 and push e4 to gain space in the centre.} 

14...c5 {Black plays the freeing move and the Bishop on b7 now breathes fire along the a8-h1 diagonal.The e4 pawn push needs more hard work from White}

15. a4 {White has to change his plan as 15.Bd3 to push e4 looks unattractive at the moment.
The idea of pushing ...Rd8 on move 9 is much clearer now. 
15.Bd3 with an idea of pushing allows Black to play 15...Rac8 16.Rac1 Nb8 clearing the Rook's control over the d4 square making e4 impossible.
15.Bd3 Rac6 16.e4? is bad because 16...cxd4 17.Nxd4? Nc5! attacking the Knight and the Bishop on d3 indirectly. White will loose a piece.
White plans to push a5 and then use Black's b6 pawn as a pivot to open up the Queenside files}

15...a5 {Black nips White's plan in the bud}

16.Bd3 {White waits as the Bishop's activity is improved}

16...h6 {A useful waiting move providing some luft to the Black King on the h7 square}

17.Rab1 {White puts more pressure on the backward b6 pawn.Rb3 followed by Qb2 is an idea to create pressure on the b6 pawn}

17...Rac8 {Improving the Queen Rook's position and Black now threatens ...cxd4 and after White replies exd4 then Black would play ...Nd5 taling advantage of the pinned pawn on c4}

18.Qd1* {The Queen goes to the home square to avoid the threat}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6{Another popular response is 1...d5.}

2.c4 {Gaining space and also controlling the d5 square. The Knight on b1 can now come to c3 depending on Black's choice of moves.}

2...e6 {Black opens the a3-f8 diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop}

3.Nc3 Bb4 {The Nimzo-Indian defence.White's Knight on c3 was protecting the e4 square and White was threatening to gain a massive central pawn mass with e2-e4.The Black Bishop pinnning the Knight on c3
is the beginning of a solid defensive idea for Black. Nimzo-Indian defence is considered to a rock-solid response and many players from the White side tend to avoid it by playing 
3.Nf3}

4.e3 {The Rubinstein variation where White does not mind ...Bxc3+ and getting a damaged pawn structure. White main emphasis 
is on quick development. This move opens the diagonal for the Bishop on f1}

4...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

5.Bd3 {The e4 square is given more protection and again e2-e4 is threatened}

5...d5 {Stopping ...e4}

6.Nf3 {White wants to castle and complete development}

6...c5 {The threat is ...cxd4 and hence White cannot push e4 again. In this main line Black has an equal stake in the centre}

7.O-O Nc6 {Adding more pressure on the pawn on d4 and preventing e2-e4. This is the standard opening theory}

8.a3 {White can also decide to exchange pawns in the centre with cxd5 and leave Black with a possible isolated pawn that can be targeted later
The well-trodden path is to win the Bishop pair with 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3.
However, White's Bishop pair is offset with the damaged pawn structure}

8...Bxc3 9.bxc3 {White eliminates Black's Bishop pair}

9...Qc7 {The most common continuation Black does not commit to any pawn breaks in the centre}

10.Bb2 {White places the Bishop on the a1-h8 diagonal and wants to play cxd5 followed by c4 to activate the dark-squared Bishop}

10...dxc4 {Black could also have played 10...Na5 forcing White to play 11.cxd5}

11.Bxc4 {White now has the Bishop pair but Black is not too bad either}

11...e5 {Putting more pressure on the d4 pawn and clearing the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8}

12.h3 {...Bg4 is an annoying pin that White prevents}

12...Bf5 {Black develops the last remaining Bishop and connects Rooks}

13.Bb5* {Attacking the defender of the e5 pawn forcing Black to take a decision over the e5 pawn}

1.e4 e6 {The French defence is on the board. The move ...e6 is a preparatory move to play ...d5 and challenge White's central control.}

2.d4 {White's natural response. When presented with an opportunity to gain advantage over the central squares go for it! White plants both his pawns on central squares
and controls c5,d5,e5 and f5 squares in Black's camp.}

2...d5 {Black thrusts his pawn in the centre and challenges White's central control. As we can see Black has created a light-squared pawn
chain on the d5 and e6 squares. Black's deep idea is based on the fact that White will have to alter
the pawn structure in the centre.By playing ...d5 Black is also attacking the pawn on e4 and threatening ...dxe4. White will have to react to this threat. }

3.Nc3 {A good response considered to be the "best" choice for White. White not only develops a piece but also is ready to respond with 4.Nxe4 if Black were to play 3...dxe4
3.Nd2 is called the Tarrasch variation while 3.e5 is the advanced variation both leading to slow positional struggles}

3...Bb4 {The Winawer variation. Black's response is radical because Black by playing ...e6 and ...d5 has rendered the Bishop on c8 weak.
The move played pins the White Knight on c3 and renews the  threat of ...dxe4. Black is also ready to exchange the Bishop for the Knight
by playing ...Bxc3+ and give White doubled pawns on the c-file after
White replies with bxc3.
Black also wants to play ...b6 followed by ...Ba6 to exchange his problem Bishop or Black can also play ...Bd7-e8-g6 in some lines.
This however, allows White a great counter-advantage as White can exert great pressure on the Kingside by playing Qg4 and attacking the pawn on g7}

4.e5 {White's usual response. Now White has altered the pawn structure and created a dark-squared pawn chain on the d4 and e5 squares. Black's main ideas now revolve
around by developing pieces and pawns to attack this pawn chain's base on the d4 square followed by ...f6 later to attack the pawn spearhead on the e5 square.}

4...c5 {Black gets his own stake in the centre}

5.a3 {The main line continuation to grab the Bishop pair}

5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 {White gets doubled pawns as a downside to the Bishop pair.Black on the other hand is weak on the dark squares as the Bishop is exchanged}

6...Qa5!? {The Portisch-Hook variation as it is known}

7.Bd2 {The best defence}

7...Qa4 {The main idea of this Queen sortie is to attack the pawns on d4 and c2. White's dangerous motif in this variation is to play Qg4 and threaten the pawn on g7.Byt playing the move ...Qa4 Black hopes to prevent White from executing the plan}

8.Qg4!? {An ambitious move where the pawn on d4 is protected but the pawn on c2 is left as a gambit. White Queen is willing to damage Black's Kingside with Qxg7}

8...Kf8!? {The Black King protects the dark squares!. This idea though makes castling impossible.Now ...Qxc2 is in the air}

9.h4?! {Not a good move. White believes that the Black King can simply be checkmated soon.9.Nf3 was more accurate.}

9...Ne7 {Black's idea is to play ...Qxc2 followed by ...Qg6 to neutralise White's attacking chances. The Knight on e7 also prepares to capture ...Nxg6 if White trades Queens with Qxg6}

10.h5?! {White pushes the pawn forward with possible ideas like Rh1-h3-g3.}

10...h6 {It is necessary to halt the pawn march. 10...Nbc6?! is a bad choice as it allows White to play 11.h6! 
Now Black cannot play 11...g6? as this leaves the f6-g7 squares as glaring holes for White to
exploit. 12.Qf4 and with moves like Ng1-f3-g5 threatening Qf7# Black will be in a bad shape.
Also 10...Nbc6?! 11.h6! gxh6 12.Nf3 Qxc2 with the idea of retreating to g6 also does not give Black a comfortable game.
13.Rc1 Qg6 14.Bxh6+! Ke8 15.Qf4 and Black is playing a tough game to survive}

11.Rh3!? {White wants to attack with the Queen-Rook battery on the f7 or g7 square depending upon Black's response. White wants check-mate at any cost! }

11...Nbc6 {Developing the Knight which can go to d8 and protect the f7 square if required}

12.Qf4 {The next move is probably Rf3 threatening mate on f7!}

12...Qxc2 {Another Queen move to capture a pawn!
Black could also have played 12...c4 to keep the centre closed and also hinder the activity of White's Bishop on f1. 
Since White has already made another Queen move in order to
mate the Black King, it seems prudent to capture the pawn on c2 now.}

13.Bd3* {Developing the Bishop and attacking the Queen}
