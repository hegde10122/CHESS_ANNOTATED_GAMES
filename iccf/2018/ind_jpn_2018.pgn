1.d4 d5 {The Queen's pawn game}

2.c4 e6 {The Queen's gambit declined or QGD as it is known}

3.Nc3 {White intends to push for e4 at some point}

3...Nf6 {Development that halts e4 for the moment.All standard theory}

4.cxd5 exd5 {White releases the tension in the centre by going for the exchange variation of the QGD and Black recaptures with the pawn in order to free the Bishop}

5.Bg5 {The main developing move in the exchange variation.The c1 square is vacated for the Rook}

5...c6 {5...Be7 is also good looking for O-O on the next move}

6.e3 {White frees the diagonal for the White Bishop to come to d3}
6...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

7.Bh4 {Maintaining the pin}

7...Be7 {Development that unpins the knight and prepares O-O.Good chess}

8.Bd3 {White begins his first step in the QGD plan - preventing Black from developing his light-squared Bishop to an ideal square.
This brings us back to the earlier Black move ...Be7.
Black could have instead played 7...Be5 to ensure that White does not carry out his plan.}

8...O-O {The Kingside development is complete}

9.Qc2 {Adding more weight to the e4 and f5 squares}

9...Bd6 {Not sure about this manouevre but 9...Re8 looks much better}

10.Nge2 {Not allowing ...Bg4 with the threat of ...Bxf3.Also allowing Bg3 in case ...g5 is pushed. White can recapture the dark-squared Bishop with the Knight in case Black decides to trade Bishops}

10...Re8 {Putting pressure on the e-file.Good chess}

11.h3 {Not allowing ...Bg4}

11...b6 {The Bishop will now arrive at b7 or a6}

12.O-O {Safety of the King is important before any serious initiative}

12...a5 {Black is aiming for a Queenside expansion.A slightly better move was to play 12...Ba6 aiming to exchange light-squared Bishops}

13.Rfe1 {Developing the Rook on a central file}

13...Be7 {The Bishop comes back to a defensive square}

14.Rad1 {White is slowly building up pressure in the centre}

14...b5 {Black continues with the pawn expansion on the Queenside grabbing more space}

15.Nb1 {The Knight will be kicked as soon as Black plays ...b4.Preparing to re-manouevre the Knight to d2 and control the e4 square}

15...a4 {Black continues the pawn march but the Queenside pieces are yet to be developed. 15...Bb7 looks better}

16.a3 {Allowing Black to push ...a3 and ...b4 would create a "thorn" pawn complex which could be difficult to dislodge}

16...Qb6 {Preparing ...b4}

17.Nec3 {Stops ...b4 for the moment as the a4 pawn will then lose a key defender allowing White to play Nxa4.
Also White is preparing Nd2 followed by the e4 pawn break in the centre.
White is following the old chess principle - Look for opportunities in the centre when the opponent is busy carrying a flank operation}

17...Nbd7 {The Knight on f6 gets an added protection and Black is preparing to push ...b4 at an opportune moment.Earlier ...b4 was not possible as the Bishop on e7 was overloaded.
...17.b4 would be met with 18.Bxf6 Bxf6 17.Nxa4 Qa5 18.Nc5! securing a nice outpost for the Knight}

18.Nd2 {Adding more steel to the e4 square. White cannot stop the ...b4 advance}

18...Bd6 {Black intends to push g5 and then capture ...Bxg3 to damage the pawn structure on the Kingside}

19.Rc1 {The Rook wants to support the Queen in putting pressure on the backward pawn on c6}

19...g5  {Black wants to exchange Bishops and damage White's pawn structure}

20.Bg3 {The only good move}

20...Bxg3 21.fxg3 {White's pawn structure on the Kingside is damaged}

21...g4 {Looking to create counterplay}

22.Na2!? {White wants to capture the pawn on c6 and tatter the pawn structure of Black. If Black allows the capture on c6 then the d5 pawn will be isolated resulting in a long-term weakness}

22...Bb7 {The c6 pawn is protected but the Bishop on b7 resembles a tall pawn}

23.Bf5 {Improving the Bishop's activity.
The Bishop adds more pressure on the d7 Knight and threatens hxg4. ...Nxg4 cannot happen in that case because Bxd7 will win White a piece}

23...Qc7 {Attacking the pawn on g3}

24.Kh2 {The King gets into the firing line of the Black Queen to protect the pawn.But the King is safe}

24...Nh5 {Piling up more pressure on the g3 pawn}

25.Nf1 {The Knight comes back to shore up the defence of the attacked pawn}

25...gxh3 {The hanging pawn is exchanged} 26.gxh3 Qd6 {A waiting move}
27.Nb4 {The Knight's position is improved and a third piece attacks the backward pawn on c6}
27...Nb6?! {Hard to understand the idea behind this move.27...Nhf6 was much better as the Knight on h5 is not fulfilling any meaningful objective}
28.Nxc6 {The pawn on c6 was ready to be munched.}  
28...Nc4 {Cutting off the Queen's support to the Knight on c6 and also attacking the White pawn on e3}
29.Nb4 {The Knight is back as there is nothing else to be done from the c6 square}
29...Nf6 {The Knight goes back and gets ready for a different plan.Black could have also attempted the tricky idea 
and win back the pawn 29...Rxe3! 30.Rxe3  Nxe3 31.Qf2 Nxf5 32.Qxf5 where Black is okay. 31.Nxe3? is a mistake because of 31.Qxg3+ 
32.Kh1 Qxe3 and Black is better}
30.Qg2 {The Queen switches over to the Kingside with pressure on the isolated d5 pawn. White's main goal is to regroup his Bishop and the Knight on f1
with moves like Nf1-d2-f3 and Bf5-d3 }
30...Bc8 {Looking to exchange Bishops}
31.Bd3 {The light-squared Bishop is retained as Black's conterpart on c8 remains short of good squares.31.Bxf8 Raxc8 would solve some problems for 
Black}

31...Ne4 {The Knight jumps in to block the White Bishop's vigil and also has an eye on the g3 pawn. 
Another move worth playing was 31...Ra7 with an intention of playing ...Rae7 and doubling the Rooks on the e-file}

32.Bxe4 {It is better to trade the Bishop for the Knight and create more space.}

32...Rxe4 {The Rook now also becomes the second attacker of the White pawn on e3. Black will now most probably try ...Qe6 to add a third attacker to the pawn on e3}

33.Rc2 {The Rook will come to f2 for more activity on the Kingside} 

33...Bd7 {This problematic piece finds itself good enough to be used for waiting moves!}

34.Rf2 {As planned the Rook comes on to the active f-file}

34...Rf8 {Black protects f7 in advance. 34...Rae8 followed by ...R8e7 looks to be more pragmatic as Black maintains his pressure on the e-file}

35.Nd3 {Nc5 is threatened to control the e4 square}

35...Re7 {Taking evasive action before White acts}

36.Nf4 {The Knight comes over to pressurise the d5 pawn and now threatens Qxd5 next.}

36...Bc6 {Black's Bishop again gomes on a passive mission to protect the d5 pawn}

37.g4 {Vacating the g3 square for the Knight on f1 as White slowly builds up pressure on the Kingside}

37...Rfe8 {Adding a third attacker on he e3 pawn}

38.g5{White wants to open up the game and bring out the latent energy in his pieces}

38...Kh8 {The King gets out of danger. 38...hxg5?? will lose to 39.Qxg5+ and White's major pieces will hunt down the 
Black King. 39...Kh7 40.Qh4+ Qh6 41.Nh5 and with moves like Rf6 to follow, Black will have to give up material to stave off mate}

39.Ng3 {White improves the Knight' position and leaves the e3 pawn as a bait.39.Qf3 is also good for White}

39...Bd7 {White's threat of fork after Nf5 is scuttled}

40.Qxd5 {White grabs a pawn}

40...Bc6 {The Black Bishop has hardly done anything concrete in the entire game. Now trying to make amends with two pawns down}

41.Qxd6 Nxd6 {Nice time to exchange Queens and go into a better endgame}

42.g6 {Setting a trap for Black after 42...fxg6 43.Nxg6+ forking the Rook and the King}

42...Rxe3 {Black grabs the central pawn}

43.Rc1 {Attacking the Bishop}

43...Be4 {The Bishop attacks the pawn on g6.}

44.Nxe4 {The Bishop is removed and White simplifies}
44.R3xe4 45.Rg1 {The action switches over to the Kingside}
45...fxg6 {The nagging White pawn is out of the window}
46.Nxg6+ {White will win the exchange here as the King is in a tight corner}
46...Kh7 {Only move that evades the check on the g-file}
47.Nf8+ Rxf8 {47...Kh8? 48.Rf6 threatening Rxh6#}
48.Rxf8 Rxd4 {White gets an exchange and is into a winning endgame}
49.Rg2 {White defends the second rank with the Rook}
49...Re4 {Black Rook is ready for more action}
50.Rb8 {The Rook keeps pressure on the b5 pawn}
50...Re5 {The Knight is ready to fly!}
51.Rbg8 {Threatening mate on g7 with the other Rook on g2}
51.Re7 {Preventing mate}
52.Rb8 {Rb6 is an idea}
52...Re5 {Protecting the b5 pawn one more time}
53.Rb6 Rd5 {Protecting the Knight as well}
54.Re2* {Re6 followed by Rxh6 is an idea after Black moves the twice-attacked Knight}

1.e4 e6 {Black answers the King's pawn opening with the popular French defense}

2.d4 d5 {White grabs the centre with the dual central pawns while Black counters White's stake in the centre with a
move of his own.Black follows the strategy of creating a light-squared pawn complex in the centre}

3.e5 {The advance variation of the French defence. The other popular variations on move 3 are 3.Nc3 known as the classical variation considered to be the best resonse for White and 3.Nd2 is called the Tarrasch variation}

3...c5 {White fixed his pawns in the centre on dark-squares and Black's strategy is to undermine this structure by attacking them.
To begin with,Black attacks the base of the pawn chain d4 with a flank pawn on the c-file}

4.Nf3 {4.c3 was the better move. This move allows Black to attain his first objective on the earlier move without any issue}

4...cxd4 {Black captures the pawn and has already equalised}

5.Bd3?! {White goes for the Ruisdonk Gambit in return for quick development}

5...Nc6 {The most popular continuation where Black holds onto the pawn by developing the Knight}

6.O-O {Rapid development.Consistent with the gambit}

6...Bd7 {Developing the Bishop and preparing ...Rc8}

7.Re1 {White develops his Rook keeping in mind the fact that the Black King is still on the e-file}

7...Bc5 {The move looks ugly but Black anticipates White to play Nc3-d2-b3 to recover the pawn.The Bishop can go to b6 to guard the extra pawn and also the e7 square is now free for the Knight on g8}

8.c3 {White offers another pawn so that the Knight can dvelop on the conventional c3 square}

8...dxc3 {Black accepts the pawn and frees the a7-g1 diagonal for the Bishop}

9.Nxc3 {White follows his plan}

9...a6 {Preventing Nb5 idea. Black does not want Nd6+ which will force Black to trade his dark-squared Bishop for the Knight.
The move played also vacates the a7 square for the Bishop if White decides to play Na4 next. 9...Nge7 is anothe good alternative}

10.a3?! {Aiming b4 with a Queenside expansion. This move does not develop any piece and against the idea of rapid development.
White's dark-squared Bishop could have been developed to e3 looking to exchange Black's Bishop on  c5.

10.Na4 Ba7 11.Be3 was also okay for White.White must remember that he is a pawn down and gambit play needs to be penetrative and sharp or else the extra pawn for Black will turn out to be a gift}

10...Nge7 {Black continues to develop with moves like ...Ng6 and ...O-O on the cards}

11.b4 {Expanding on the Queenside and attacking the Bishop.White has to be aggressive}

11...Ba7 {Retreating back on the active diagonal}

12.Bb2 {White develops the dark-squared Bishop on a square that adds more influence on the d4 square}

12...Rc8 {Black Rook exerts pressure on the open c-file}

13.Ne2 {Perhaps White will redirect the Knight to g3 or d4 to join the attack}

13...Ng6 {Preventing Nf4 on the next move but importantly adding more pressure on the e5 pawn}

14.g3?!{The move not only weakens the light-squares f3 and h3 around the White King but also denies the Knight on e2 a good square.
The only positive is that White can play h4 followed by h5.But is it good enough for an attack on the Black King. Only time will tell.

14.Ng3 looks a natural continuation after White's previous move.}

14...O-O {Black has nothing to worry as White's pieces are not coordinated}

15.Kg2 {Not sure about this move, but Rh1 followed by h4,h5 seems to be the idea}

15...Bb8 {By attacking the central pawn on e5 thrice Black is following the old chess principle - When the opposition is looking or indulging in a flank attack, try and create
a meaningful counterplay in the centre }

16.Nf4 {The Rook on e1 becomes the third support for the e5 pawn now}

16...Nxf4 17.gxf4 {As a pair of Knights fly off the board it is important to take stock of the situation - White has a wrecked pawn structure on the Kingside and an open g-file for the Rooks and Queen
Black is a pawn up, has an excellent pawn structure but the pieces are cramped.}

17...f6 {An important decision in the game. Black needs to maximise the pawn advantage. By playing a cramped game
Black is doing nothing great to seize advantage. The pawn spearhead on e5 is attacked and Black wants to rip apart the pawn structure.
Black is also willing to sacrifice the exchange if Black accepts the challenge 18.gxf6 Rxf6 19.Bxf6 Qxf6 and Black will then have a Bishop and a pawn for the Rook}

18.exf6 Rxf6 {Offering an exchange sacrifice to open up the game}

19.Bxf6 Qxf6 {White accepts the sacrifice and an imbalance is created White has a Rook against a Bishop and a pawn}

20.f5 {Hoping to exchange the attacked pawn}

20...e5 {Black has an excellent centre}

21.Bxa6 {White has no chance of saving the pawn on f5 after Black plays ...Ne7.Instead White decides to grab two pawns for a piece}

21...bxa6 22.Qxd5+ {White gets the central d5 pawn in return.White now a Rook against Black's Bishop pair with four pawns each. Black looks better}

22...Qf7 {Forced as the Bishop on d7 was enprise}

23.Qxf7 Kxf7 {The Queens go off the board}

24.Rac1 {White develops the last piece on to a meaningful square controlling the c-file}

24...Bxf5 {The pawn is grabbed and now it is going to be a battle between the Bishop pair and White's Rook soon}

25.Ng5+ {White's Knight advances further}

25...Ke7 {25...Kf6 26.Ne4+ Ke7 and Black's King will have to go back to e7 in any case. Look how the rush to attack White's Knight actually ends up wasting a tempo for Black}

26.h4 {White waits}

26...h6 {Kicking the Knight back}

27.Ne4 {White posts the Knight on the central e4 square}

27...Nd4 {Looking to exchange a pair of Rooks}

28.Rxc8 Bxc8 {Black is looking better now}

29.Nc5 {Attacking the pawn on a6}

29...h5 {Fixing the pawn on h4.
..Nf5 is an idea that will add more pressure on the h4 pawn.Black King will now go to g4 via f6 and f5 to attack the pawn on h4}

30.f3 {The g4 square is now controlled by White.}

30...Nf5 {Attacking the pawn on h4}

31.Kf2 {White wants Black to capture 31...Nxh4 allowing 32.Rh1 with some counterplay}
31...g6 {Black is now ready to play ...Nxh4 next}

32.Re4 {Protecting the h4 pawn. Perhaps White could have tried the alternative 32.f4 and attacked the pinned pawn}

32...Kd6 {The King is centralised nicely and ...Ba7 followed by ...Bxc5 is an idea where Black can win a pawn on c5}

33.f4 {White attacks the e5 pawn a move too late.}

33...Kd5 {It is said that the King is as good as a minor piece in an endgame. 
This move amplifies that adage. The e5 pawn has another defender on b8.The King now has an easy path to c4-b3 and gobble up White's pawns.
White resigned}0-1
