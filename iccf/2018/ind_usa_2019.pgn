1.d4 Nf6 

2.c4 e6 

3.Nf3  {White avoids the Nimzo-Indian}

3...d5 {The Queen's gambit declined by transposition}

4.g3 {The Catalan}

4...dxc4 {Black grabs the pawn and gives p centre control}

5.Bg2 {The Catalan move order where White is looking for strategic gains. Here White controls the h1-a8 diagonal. White can still capture the 
pawn back with Qa4+ followed by Qxc4}

5...Nc6 {A popular variation against the Catalan. Here Black's goal is to play ...Rb8 if White plays 6.O-O and then protect the extra pawn with ...b5}

6.Qa4 {A theoretical line where White wants to get back the pawn on c4 and fight for an opening advantage}

6...Bb4+ {The main line}

7.Bd2 {All standard theory}

7...Nd5 {Bolstering the Bishop with the access to the c4 pawn blocked}

8.Bxd4* {White goes for simplification which is the most popular continuation}

1.e4 d6 {The Pirc-Ufimtsev defense is on the board} 

2.d4 Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn with development}

3.Nc3 {Protecting the e4 pawn}

3...g6 {Fianchetto followed by castling is the main line}

4.f4  {The dangerous Austrian atack where White plans to run down Black on the Kingside}

4...Bg7  {Black has to develop the Bishop - the best move in this position}

5.Nf3  {White is consistent with his piece development}

5...c5 {5...O-O is the riskier option where a misstep from Black can spell disaster. The move played is also quite popular and Black challenges 
White to take a call with his central d-pawn}

6.Bb5+ {Theoretically the best move and considered to be the main line}

6...Bd7 {Challenging his counterpart. 6...Nfd7?! is bad because 7.dxc5! dxc5 8.e5 and White gains space and Black is left with an inferior pawn structure }

7.e5 {White begins the attack}

7...Ng4 {7...Ng8 is placid and does no justice to Black's aggressive opening choice}

8.Bxd7+ {White goes for a lighter option. 8.e6!? was a more complex option ruining Black's pawn structure after 8...fxe6}

8...Qxd7 {Forced as 8...Nxd7? allows White to play 9.e6! fxe6 10.Ng5+ with White's attacking chances amplified}

9.h3!? {A move laced with poison. White's idea is to corner the Knight and hen expand with g4. This idea is consistnt with the attacking plans}

9...cxd4!? {The Pirc solution where Black introduces complications of his own by attacking the Knight}

10.Qxd4 {White centralises the Queen with this capture}

10...Nc6 {Development with tempo}

11.Qe4 {The Queen is not going back and keeps herself on an active post}

11...Nh6* {The Knight has to go back and the position is reasonable for Black}
