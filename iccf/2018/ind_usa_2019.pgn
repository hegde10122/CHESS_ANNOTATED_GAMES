1.d4 Nf6  {The Indian defence is a popular answer to the Queen's pawn opening}

2.c4 e6 {Black wants to develop the Bishop on f8 and castle quickly}

3.Nf3  {White avoids the Nimzo-Indian}

3...d5 {The Queen's gambit declined by transposition}

4.g3 {The Catalan}

4...dxc4 {Black grabs the pawn and gives p centre control}

5.Bg2 {The Catalan move order where White is looking for strategic gains. Here White controls the h1-a8 diagonal. White can still capture the 
pawn back with Qa4+ followed by Qxc4}

5...Nc6 {A popular variation against the Catalan. Here Black's goal is to play ...Rb8 if White plays 6.O-O and then protect the extra pawn with ...b5}

6.Qa4 {A theoretical line where White wants to get back the pawn on c4 and fight for an opening advantage}

6...Bb4+ {The main line}

7.Bd2 {All standard theory}

7...Nd5 {Bolstering the Bishop with the access to the c4 pawn blocked}

8.Bxb4 {White goes for simplification which is the most popular continuation}

8...Ndxb4 {Forced}

9.O-O {White nestles his King to safety}

9...Rb8 {The most popular response. Preparing ...b5}

10.Na3  {Attacking the pawn on c4 and preventing ...b5}

10...O-O {Black castles and the Knight on c6 is no longer pinned}

11.Qb5 {The only move to get back the pawn}

11...b6 {The Bishop will come out on b7 or a6}

12.Qxc4* {White gets back the pawn}

1.e4 d6 {The Pirc-Ufimtsev defense is on the board} 

2.d4 Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn with development}

3.Nc3 {Protecting the e4 pawn}

3...g6 {Fianchetto followed by castling is the main line}

4.f4  {The dangerous Austrian atack where White plans to run down Black on the Kingside}

4...Bg7  {Black has to develop the Bishop - the best move in this position}

5.Nf3  {White is consistent with his piece development}

5...c5 {5...O-O is the riskier option where a misstep from Black can spell disaster. The move played is also quite popular and Black challenges 
White to take a call with his central d-pawn}

6.Bb5+ {Theoretically the best move and considered to be the main line}

6...Bd7 {Challenging his counterpart. 6...Nfd7?! is bad because 7.dxc5! dxc5 8.e5 and White gains space and Black is left with an inferior pawn structure }

7.e5 {White begins the attack}

7...Ng4 {7...Ng8 is placid and does no justice to Black's aggressive opening choice}

8.Bxd7+ {White goes for a lighter option. 8.e6!? was a more complex option ruining Black's pawn structure after 8...fxe6}

8...Qxd7 {Forced as 8...Nxd7? allows White to play 9.e6! fxe6 10.Ng5+ with White's attacking chances amplified}

9.h3!? {A move laced with poison. White's idea is to corner the Knight and hen expand with g4. This idea is consistnt with the attacking plans}

9...cxd4!? {The Pirc solution where Black introduces complications of his own by attacking the Knight}

10.Qxd4 {White centralises the Queen with this capture}

10...Nc6 {Development with tempo}

11.Qe4 {The Queen is not going back and keeps herself on an active post}

11...Nh6 {The Knight has to go back and the position is reasonable for Black}

12.Be3 {Preparing O-O-O}

12...Nf5 {Attacking the Bishop}

13.Bf2 {The Bishop is protected}

13...dxe5 {13...O-O? looks natural but is bad as 14.O-O-O will allow White to create a pawn storm on the Kingside.14...Rae8 15.g4 Nh6 and White will have a 
great attack going}

14.fxe5 {Opening the f-file anf controlling the d6 square. 14.Nxe5 allows 14...Nd6 and if White trades Queens then the attack evaporates} 

14...Nxe5 {A temporary Knight sacrifice as Black removes the wedge pawn on e5 }

15.Nxe5 {White has to accept the sacrifice or else he will lose a pawn for nothing}

15...Qe6* {The Knight on e5 is attacked twice now and there is no pawn to protect the Knight. The White King is still on e1 and the Rooks are also 
at home}
