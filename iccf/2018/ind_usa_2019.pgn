1.e4 d6 {The Pirc-Ufimtsev defense is on the board}

2.d4 Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn with development}

3.Nc3 {Protecting the e4 pawn}

3...g6 {Fianchetto followed by castling is the main line}

4.f4  {The dangerous Austrian attack where White plans to run down Black on the Kingside}

4...Bg7  {Black has to develop the Bishop - the best move in this position}

5.Nf3  {White is consistent with his piece development}

5...c5 {5...O-O is the riskier option where a misstep from Black can spell disaster. The move played is also quite popular and Black challenges
White to take a call with his central d-pawn}

6.Bb5+ {Theoretically the best move and considered to be the main line}

6...Bd7 {Challenging his counterpart. 6...Nfd7?! is bad because 7.dxc5! dxc5 8.e5 and White gains space and Black is left with an inferior pawn structure }

7.e5 {White begins the attack}

7...Ng4 {7...Ng8 is placid and does no justice to Black's aggressive opening choice}

8.Bxd7+ {White goes for a lighter option. 8.e6!? was a more complex option ruining Black's pawn structure after 8...fxe6}

8...Qxd7 {Forced as 8...Nxd7? allows White to play 9.e6! fxe6 10.Ng5+ with White's attacking chances amplified}

9.h3!? {A move laced with poison. White's idea is to corner the Knight and hen expand with g4. This idea is consistnt with the attacking plans}

9...cxd4!? {The Pirc solution where Black introduces complications of his own by attacking the Knight}

10.Qxd4 {White centralises the Queen with this capture}

10...Nc6 {Development with tempo}

11.Qe4 {The Queen is not going back and keeps herself on an active post}

11...Nh6 {The Knight has to go back and the position is reasonable for Black}

12.Be3 {Preparing O-O-O}

12...Nf5 {Attacking the Bishop}

13.Bf2 {The Bishop is protected}

13...dxe5 {13...O-O? looks natural but is bad as 14.O-O-O will allow White to create a pawn storm on the Kingside.14...Rae8 15.g4 Nh6 and White will have a
great attack going}

14.fxe5 {Opening the f-file anf controlling the d6 square. 14.Nxe5 allows 14...Nd6 and if White trades Queens then the attack evaporates}

14...Nxe5 {A temporary Knight sacrifice as Black removes the wedge pawn on e5 }

15.Nxe5 {White has to accept the sacrifice or else he will lose a pawn for nothing}

15...Qe6 {The Knight on e5 is attacked twice now and there is no pawn to protect the Knight. The White King is still on e1 and the Rooks are also
at home}

16.O-O-O {White castles long and brings out the Rook on the active d-file. The b7 pawn can be captured later}

16...Bxe5 {The piece is retrieved back}

17.Rhe1 {White threatens to win the Bishop on e5}

17...Bxc3 {Black simplifies further. 17...f6 also looks okay for Black. 18.Qxb7 O-O 19.g4 Nd6 20.Qd5 Qf7 and Black look fine}

18.Qxb7 {White grabs a pawn back and attacks the Rook}

18...Qc8 {Offering to trade Queens}
19.Qb5+  {With tempo}
19...Kf8 {The only move that does not lose material}
20.bxc3 Qxc3 {The Queen grabs another pawn}
21.g4 {Attacking the Knight now.21.Rd7 was another good move to infiltrate the seventh rank and keeping control over the d-file}
21...Nd6 {Attacking the Queen}
22.Qa4 {22.Qe5 exchanging Queens is not a good idea as White is a pawn down}
22...Qa1+ {Forcing the King onto the d-file}
23.Kd2 {The only move}
23...Qf6 {The attacked Queen is back keeping an eye on the e7 pawn as well.}
24.Bd4 {Attacking the Queen and Rook - skewer}
24...Qg5+ {Nothing to worry for Black}
25.Be3 {Blocking again}
25...Qf6 {Repeating the same position as on move 23}
26.Bh6+ {White's hope of utilising the dark squares have not dimmed}
26...Kg8 27.Qf4 {Offering to exchange Queens. White missed an opportunity to crank up the pressure with 27.g5 Qf2+ forced as any other move without check would
allow White to double the Rooks on the d-file after Kc1,Rd3,Red1 etc. After 27...Qf2+ 28.Kc1 Nf5  with an intention of eliminating the monster Bishop
29.Re4 with an intention of bringing the other Rook to e1 and increasing the pressure on the e7 pawn.29...Nxh6 30.gxh6 Qc5 and Black looks okay}
27...Qxf4 {Accepting Queen exchange is the only sane option.
27...Qh4? 28.Bg5 and the with fall of the e7 pawn the defence of the Black King will eventually collapse
27...Ne8? 28.Qxf6 exf6 29.Re7! and the Black King and the Rook on h8 will be stuck on passive squares forever. The other White Rook will join the party on the d7 square and Black will be busted}
28.Bxf4 Kf8 {Protecting the e7 pawn}
29.Bh6+ Ke8 {29...Kg8?? 30.Rxe7 and Black's Rook on h8 will become a dead piece forever!}
336...Ra6.0.Bg5 {The e7 pawn is under siege}
30...Nc8 {30...e6 creates a hole on f6.31.Bf6 Rg8 and White has managed to create a weak pawn on f7 that can be exploited later}
31.Rb1 {Rb3-d3 is an idea}
31...Kd8 {The Black King gets out of the e-file}
32.Rb3 h6 {Black asks the Bishop to step back}
33.Rd3+ Ke8 {What else ?}
34.Bf6 {The Rook on h8 is attacked}
34...Rg8 {34...Rf8 seems okay as well}
35.Kc1 {The King is now safe and White looks forward to regroup his pair of Rooks}
35...a5 {A necessary move that vacates the a7 square for the Rook. Black can also play ...Ra6 and put the question to the Bishop on f6}
36.Re5 {White prepares Red5 and threatens to mate on d8 square}
36...g5 {Vacating the g6 square for the Rook and end White's stranglehold on the e7 pawn.36...Ra6.Putting the question to the Bishop was also playable.}
37.Rde3 {More pressure on the e7 pawn}
37...Ra7 {Ugly looking but effective defence}
38.Rc3 {Attacking the Knight}
38...Nd6 {The Knight is safe here}

39...Kf8 {Finally out of the annoying pin on e7}

47.Ke4 Rd2 {The Rook is now ready to gobble up the second rank pawns}
48.gxh5 Re2+ {Black forces the King to dance around}

1.d4 Nf6  {The Indian defence is a popular answer to the Queen's pawn opening}

2.c4 e6 {Black wants to develop the Bishop on f8 and castle quickly}

3.Nf3  {White avoids the Nimzo-Indian}

3...d5 {The Queen's gambit declined by transposition}

4.g3 {The Catalan}

4...dxc4 {Black grabs the pawn and gives up centre control}

5.Bg2 {The Catalan move order where White is looking for strategic gains. Here White controls the h1-a8 diagonal. White can still capture the
pawn back with Qa4+ followed by Qxc4}

5...Nc6 {A popular variation against the Catalan. Here Black's goal is to play ...Rb8 if White plays 6.O-O and then protect the extra pawn with ...b5}

6.Qa4 {A theoretical line where White wants to get back the pawn on c4 and fight for an opening advantage}

6...Bb4+ {The main line}

7.Bd2 {All standard theory}

7...Nd5 {Bolstering the Bishop with the access to the c4 pawn blocked}

8.Bxb4 {White goes for simplification which is the most popular continuation}

8...Ndxb4 {Forced}

9.O-O {White nestles his King to safety}

9...Rb8 {The most popular response. Preparing ...b5}

11...b6 {The Bishop will come out on b7 or a6}

12.Qxc4 {White gets back the pawn}

12...Ba6 {Attacking the Queen}

13.Nb5 {If the Queen were to move then the pawn on e2 would fall}

13...Qe8 {The Queen overprotects the Knight on c6 as White threatens a3. 13...Qd5 14.Qxd5 Nxd5 would lead to a drawish game}

14.Rfd1 {14.Rfc1 was also possible. This move adds more strength to the d4 pawn}

14...Nxa2 {Black goes for tactics and wins a pawn}

15.Rxa2 {Forced or the Knight goes back to b4}

15...Na5 {Protecting the Bishop on a6 and attacking the defender of the Knight on b5. The Queen must go back and allow Black to recapture
the piece}

16...Bxb5 {Black gets back the Knight}

17.Ng5 {Threatening Qxh7#}

17...g6 {17...f5 looks more fragile as it creates a "hole" on e5}

18.b4 {Attacking the Knight. 17.h4 is also worth consideration.}

18...Nc6 {The Knight safely retreats}
19.Ne4 {A cunning move that threatens fork on f6. This move also invites Black to push his pawn and protect the f6 square thereby creating more weaknesses
around the Black King. Black is also dared to play 19...Nxb4 having a fork of his own}
19...f6 {Black does weaken his pawn structure here}
20.Rb2 {20.Qc3 is also okay but why make the Queen a defensive piece?}

24.Nxb5 axb5 {White creates doubled pawns and hope to win back a pawn later}
25.Ra7 {Seventh rank infiltration}
25...Rd7 {Hoping to trade Rooks}
26.Rba2 {White wants to keep a Rook on the seventh rank if Black decides to liquidate}
26...Qc8 27.R2a6 Rxa7 28.Rxa7 Nd5 29.Qa2 Re8 30.e4 Nxb4 31.Qa3 Qb8 32.Rd7 c5 33.e5 Rf8 34.Rb7 Qe8 35.exf6
35...Nd5 36.dxc5 bxc5 37.Qxc5 Qc8 38.Qxb5 Qc1+
39.Bf1 {39.Qf1 allows Black to claw back into the game with reduced material on the board. 39...Qxf1+ 40.Bxf1 Rf7 and it will be hard for White to force a win}
39...Nxf6 {The pawn is gobbled up}
40.Re7 {Attacking the isolated pawn from behind as White keeps up the pressure on the seventh rank}
40...Qe1 {The pawn is protected for the moment and Black prepares ...Ng4 to pressurise the f2 pawn}
41.Qb7 {The Knight has to guard the h7 pawn and Black cannot go for ...Ng4}
41...Kh8 {A wasted move}
42.Qb2 {Pinning the Knight}
42...Kg8 {This is why move 41 was wasteful as the King has to go back to g8}
43.h4 {Wait and watch as the Knight on f6 is precariously placed}
43...e5* {...e4 followed by ...e3 is the idea to damage White's pawn structure.The Black pawn is now acting as a gambit to free Black's defensive resources}
