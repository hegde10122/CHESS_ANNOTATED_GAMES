1.e4 {The King pawn opening. Arguably the most popular opening}
1...g6 {Black wants to play the Modern defence}
2.d4 {Grabbing the centre, White expands his pawn prowess}
2...Bg7 {The Bishop will eye the long-dark diagonal}
3.Nc3 {Adding more steel to the d5 square.}
3...d6 {Preventing White from pushing e5. If White succeeds in pushing the e5 pawn then Black will run into serious problems}
4.Be3 {Nice developing move that also adds more control over the c5 square. Black cannot play ...c5 easily.4.Bg5 looks an aggressive option but this
does lose control over the e5 square. The Bishop looks better on e3.}
4...a6!? {An interesting move. This moves prepares ...b5 followed by ...Bb7. Black intends to play ...b4 at some point to attack the
defender of the e4 pawn}
5.Qd2 {A principled move that prepares O-O-O. This moves also instills a confusion in Black's thinking...Should I play ...Nf6 or not?}
5...b5 {Black goes ahead with the plan. ...Bb7 is on the cards.The only problem with Black is that only pawn moves seem to be on the menu}
6.f3 {A prophylactic move to counter ...Bb7. White also takes advantage of the fact that Black is yet to develop the Kingside and prepares g4-h4 in the future}
6...Nd7 {Black is flexible and controls the c5 square}
7.h4 {White starts pushing the pawns as Black's Kingside is yet to be developed}
7...Ngf6 {Black has two more options. 7...h6 This move controls the g5 square and
Black is ready to meet 8.h5 with 8...g5 closing the pawn structure. 7...h6 8.Nh3!? Ngf6 9.O-O-O and White keeps his options of g4 and f4 open.
7...h5. Here Black creates a "hole" on the g5 square. Nh3-Ng5 will allow White to post a gnawing piece on the g-file. Black will have to play ...Ngf6
at some point which means the g5 square is White's "home" for the majority of the game. Morever ...h5 or ...h6 allows commital pawn moves.Black
opts for flexibility and forces White to commit aggression}
8.O-O-O {White puts the King to safety before committing on the Kingside aggression}
8...Nb6 {Black cannot play ...c5 as White's heavy artillery is in complete control of the d-file. This move vacates the d7 square for the
other Knight in case White decides to go for the Kingside onslaught. The Bishop on c8 is also active now. If White decides to develop the Knight
via the h3 route then ...Bxh3 is also a possibility to neutralise White's attack. 8...Bb7 rekindles the idea of pushing ...c5 as the Queen on d8
gets protection from the Rook. But 9.Kb1 c5?! 10.dxc5 Nxc5 11.e5!? b4 12.exf6 bxc3 13.Qxc3 Bxf6 14.Bd4!? forcing Black to give away the control of the
dark squares 14...Nd7 15.Bxf6 Nxf6 16.Ng5 and White can afford to play Bc4 soon with the Black King stuck in the centre.With the dark-squared Bishop
neutralised, Black's attack on the King on b1 is no more effective as the task of connecting the Rooks is arduous and White can regroup quickly
denying Black any counterplay.}
9.Bh6 {White wants to exchange Black's lively Bishop and weeaken the dark squares around the King. A good positional idea}
9...Bxh6 10.Qxh6*

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 {White wants to avoid the Nimzo Indian after 3.Nc3 Bb4}
3...d5 {The Catalan}
4.Nf3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Be7 {Black wants to keep the Bishop pair. The White Bishop on d2 is misplaced}
6.Bg2 Nbd7 {More development as Black refuses to grab the c4 pawn and give up the central d-pawn}
7.O-O O-O {Both sides prefer development and no pawn initiatives again}
8.Qc2 {White would like to play e4 at some point.}
8...c6 9.Bf4 {Vacating the d2 square for the Knight as the Bishop on d2 is a hindrance.White's idea is to play cxd5 and then play Rac1 or Rfc1 to add
more pressure on the c-file. The Bishop on f4 guards the c7 square and White hopes to play Bc7 as well to throttle Black's Queen and hinder
development.}
9...b6 {The idea is to play ...Ba6 or ...Bb7 followed by ...Rc8}
10.cxd5 {White wants to dominate the c-file by playing Rc1 and Bc7 depending upon Black's responses}
10...cxd5 11.Rc1 Bb7*

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 {The KID}
3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.Nc3 d6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.O-O a6 {The Panno variation where Black's idea is to play ...Rb8 and ...b5 for a Queenside initiative. White's
Kingside fianchetto has blunted Black's original idea of Kingside aggression in the KID. }
8.Bf4 {White wants to play Qd2 followed by Bh6. Also Rc1 is on the cards. }
8...Rb8 {As per the plan. Black wants to strike with ...b5 and go for a Queenside expansion}
9.a4 {White plays a prophylactic move to stop the ...b5 advance.
9.Rc1 b5 10.Nd5 bxc4 11.Nxf6+ Bxf6 12.Rxc4 e5!? 13.Bh6 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Kxf8 15.Nxd4 exd4 with unclear play.Black is okay in this position}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening. Arguably the second most popular opening after 1.e4}
1...d5  {Black responds with an identical move.}
2.c4 c6 {The Slav}
3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6  {Black's idea is to play ...dxc4 and then ...b5 to protect the extra pawn} 5.e3 {The pawn on c4 is protected but the
dark-squared Bishop is now insipid}
5...Nbd7 6.Qc2 {Move preferred by theory as the e4 square gets more control. White wants to push e4 at some point}
6...Bd6 {Black wants to push ...e5 at some point to release the pressure}
7.Bd3 {White gets ready for O-O}
7...e5 {Black goes ahead with the move that frees up space. 7...O-O is also popular.Black's main threat is to play ...e4 and fork the Knight and the Bishop on d3}
8.cxd5 {Most popular choice. 8.dxe5 is also acceptable}
8...cxd5 {8...Nxd5 9.Bxh7!? Nb4 10.Qb1 exd4 11.exd4 Nf6 12.Bg5 and White has a good position}

10...Be4 11.Qc1 Bb7 12.Qc2 Nbd7 13.Ba5* {Black wants to play ...c5 with a solid position. This move pins the pawn and smothers that idea.
Also the d2 square is now available for the Knight and the Queen can continue its vigil on the c-file}
13...Rc8 {Black develops the Rook on the c-file.Black might play ...Nb6 to unpin the c7 pawn. Then Black's plan is to push ...c5 and unlock the position}
14.Nbd2* {White prepares to bring one of the Rooks to the c1 square in anticipation of ...c5 very soon}

1.d4
1...d5 2.c4 c6 {The Slav}
3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 {Be2 followed by O-O is White's idea}
4...e6 {The Meran variation}
5.b3 {Supporting the c4 pawn.Now Be2 or Bd3 can be played without losing a tempo after Black plays ...dxc4}
5...Nbd7 6.Bb2 Ne4 {White develops the weak Bishop and Black responds by putting the Knight on a more influential square. Black might opt for ...f5 and ...Ndf6 a Stonewall kind of setup.
This move also discourages White from playing Nbd2 or Nc3 as ...Bb4 is quite powerful}
7.Bd3 {White is ready to castle}
7...Bb4+ {Development and aggression from Black}
8.Nbd2 f5 {A Stonewall Dutch defense kind of a setup where Black's light-squared Bishop on c8 remains meek while the Knight on e4 is the aggressor occupying
key squares in White's setup. Black can ...Ndf6 or...Qf6 followed by ...O-O and create chances on the Kingside.}
9.O-O {White removes the pin and puts the King to safety.Now Black's aggressive Bishop on b4 has nothing great to do and Black will have to rework the
modalities of a new strategy}
9...O-O {Black too follows suit}
10.a3 {White wants to start a Queenside pawn expansion}
10...Bd6* {The e5 square has further control.Black's plausible idea includes ...g5,...Qh6,...g4 to create an attack on the King. Black's Knight on e4
is a nemesis for White at the moment.}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 c6 4.Bg2 d5 {Neo-Grunfeld} 5.Nf3 dxc4 {Black is ready to play ...b5 and protect the extra pawn}
6.a4 {Preventing ...b5}
6...Ne4 {With an idea of playing ...Nd6 to add more protection to the pawn on c4 }
7.O-O {White goes for development}
7...Bg7 {Of course ...Nd6 is premature as White has yet not revelaed his cards and Black too develops a piece}
8.Nc3 {Challenging the Knight.Would you like to go to d6 or exchange?}
8...Nd6 {Black goes with the defense of the c4 pawn. The Knight has jumped three times since the first move. Black has an extra pawn but White
has the advantage of development.Now White needs to ascertain that he grabs more space in the centre and increases the advantage further.}
9.h3 {The g4 square is now under White's control. Black could have played ...Bg4 followed by ...Qc8 to control the h3-c8 diagonal. This would have given Black sound
positional control.White could have also gone straight for 9.e4 Bg4 10.Be3 Qc8 where the position is almost equal
9.e4 is also playable but 9...Bg4 10.Be3 Qc8 gives Black sufficient counterplay as ...Bh3 is unstoppable. Neutralising the light-squared Bishop means
Black extra pawn advantage becomes more potent.}
9...O-O 10.e4 {Now e4 makes more sense as the light square Bishop on c8 lacks space to develop on a good square. The f5 square is under White's firm grip}
10...Na6* {Black wants to plant the Knight on b4 - a hole created by White's advanced pawns. ...Nd3 is also an idea to cement the Knight in White's throat}
