1.e4 {The King pawn opening. Arguably the most popular opening}
1...g6 {Black wants to play the Modern defence}
2.d4 {Grabbing the centre, White expands his pawn prowess}
2...Bg7 {The Bishop will eye the long-dark diagonal}
3.Nc3 {Adding more steel to the d5 square.}
3...d6 {Preventing White from pushing e5. If White succeeds in pushing the e5 pawn then Black will run into serious problems}
4.Be3 {Nice developing move that also adds more control over the c5 square. Black cannot play ...c5 easily.4.Bg5 looks an aggressive option but this
does lose control over the e5 square. The Bishop looks better on e3.}
4...a6!? {An interesting move. This moves prepares ...b5 followed by ...Bb7. Black intends to play ...b4 at some point to attack the
defender of the e4 pawn}
5.Qd2 {A principled move that prepares O-O-O. This moves also instills a confusion in Black's thinking...Should I play ...Nf6 or not?}
5...b5 {Black goes ahead with the plan. ...Bb7 is on the cards.The only problem with Black is that only pawn moves seem to be on the menu}
6.f3 {A prophylactic move to counter ...Bb7. White also takes advantage of the fact that Black is yet to develop the Kingside and prepares g4-h4 in the future}
6...Nd7 {Black is flexible and controls the c5 square}
7.h4 {White starts pushing the pawns as Black's Kingside is yet to be developed}
7...Ngf6 {Black has two more options. 7...h6 This move controls the g5 square and
Black is ready to meet 8.h5 with 8...g5 closing the pawn structure. 7...h6 8.Nh3!? Ngf6 9.O-O-O and White keeps his options of g4 and f4 open.
7...h5. Here Black creates a "hole" on the g5 square. Nh3-Ng5 will allow White to post a gnawing piece on the g-file. Black will have to play ...Ngf6
at some point which means the g5 square is White's "home" for the majority of the game. Morever ...h5 or ...h6 allows commital pawn moves.Black
opts for flexibility and forces White to commit aggression}
8.O-O-O {White puts the King to safety before committing on the Kingside aggression}
8...Nb6 {Black cannot play ...c5 as White's heavy artillery is in complete control of the d-file. This move vacates the d7 square for the
other Knight in case White decides to go for the Kingside onslaught. The Bishop on c8 is also active now. If White decides to develop the Knight
via the h3 route then ...Bxh3 is also a possibility to neutralise White's attack. 8...Bb7 rekindles the idea of pushing ...c5 as the Queen on d8
gets protection from the Rook. But 9.Kb1 c5?! 10.dxc5 Nxc5 11.e5!? b4 12.exf6 bxc3 13.Qxc3 Bxf6 14.Bd4!? forcing Black to give away the control of the
dark squares 14...Nd7 15.Bxf6 Nxf6 16.Ng5 and White can afford to play Bc4 soon with the Black King stuck in the centre.With the dark-squared Bishop
neutralised, Black's attack on the King on b1 is no more effective as the task of connecting the Rooks is arduous and White can regroup quickly
denying Black any counterplay.}
9.Bh6 {White wants to exchange Black's lively Bishop and weeaken the dark squares around the King. A good positional idea}
9...Bxh6 10.Qxh6 {White creates a "hole" in the black square terrain of Black. Now White still has plans of g4,Nh3 or Ne2. Black's main problem
however is the immediate threat of e5 to bust open the central files. The Black King cannot castle and now Black's hopes of gaining some parity
is to castle on the Queenside. He must hurry now or White will organise the pieces for an onslaught}
10...Bb7 {Controlling the d5 square and vacating the Queenside for a possible O-O-O. Now if 11.e5 then 11...Nd5 is possible.}
11.Nh3 {White goes for the quieter option.Ng5 is a possibility now to attack Black's camp}
11...e6 {11...Qd7? with 12...O-O-O on the cards looks to be an obvious choice. But then 12.Ng5! does not allow Black to go for long castling as the
f7 pawn loses its support. The Queen on d7 actually loses control over the dark squares. The move played also unlocks the e7 square for the King as
Qg7 allows ...Ke7 with the White Queen having to retreat back. The Black Queen cannot afford to lose control over the dark squares.}
12.e5 {White wants to open up the centre and attack the Black King on e8.A good choice}
12...dxe5 13.dxe5 Nfd7 {A good square for the Knight} 14.Qg7 Ke7 15.Qh6
15...b4 {Black pushes the pawn to slow down White's aggression. 15...Qf8 16.Qf4 and Black loses control of the fourth rank as ...b4 is not possible Now}
16.Ne2 Qf8 {Looking to exchange Queens}
17.Qf4 {Threatening 18.Qxb4}
17...Nd5 {The Knight completes the necessary defence}
18.Qd2 Nxe5 {Grabbing the pawn}
19.Nef4 {Attacking the defender of the b4 pawn}
19...Kd7 {Protecting the b4 pawn}
20.h5?! {White, in my opinion has lost out on an opportunity to make it harder for Black.
20.Ng5 with the idea of Ne4 looks much better.White also has to get the Bishop out on an active square. Instead the pawn push looks
hasty}
20...f6 {Taking away the g5 square. 20...Qe7 21.Qd4 f6 also looks okay for Black}
21.Nxd5 exd5 22.f4 Nf7 {22...Ng4?! looks intimidating }
23.Nf2 Qd6* {Shielding the King on the d-file}

3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 O-O 5.Nc3 d6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.O-O a6 {The Panno variation where Black's idea is to play ...Rb8 and ...b5 for a Queenside initiative. White's
Kingside fianchetto has blunted Black's original idea of Kingside aggression in the KID. }

10...Bf5 {Developing the Bishop}
11.Rc1 e5  {Black plays in the centre as the ...b5 idea is not playable at the moment}
12.Bd2 {White's dark squared Bishop is not the best piece at the moment hindering White's coordination on d2}
12...Nc6 {The Knight was on the radar of the Bishop on d2.}
13.d5 {White closes the centre and attacks the Knight}
13...Nb4 {The Knight lands up on the hole with ...Nd3 a possibility}

2.c4 c6 {The Slav}
3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6  {Black's idea is to play ...dxc4 and then ...b5 to protect the extra pawn} 5.e3 {The pawn on c4 is protected but the
dark-squared Bishop is now insipid}

6...Bd6 {Black wants to push ...e5 at some point to release the pressure}
7.Bd3 {White gets ready for O-O}

10...Be4 11.Qc1 Bb7 12.Qc2 Nbd7 13.Ba5 {Black wants to play ...c5 with a solid position. This move pins the pawn and smothers that idea.
Also the d2 square is now available for the Knight and the Queen can continue its vigil on the c-file}
13...Rc8 {Black develops the Rook on the c-file.Black might play ...Nb6 to unpin the c7 pawn. Then Black's plan is to push ...c5 and unlock the position}
14.Nbd2 {White prepares to bring one of the Rooks to the c1 square in anticipation of ...c5 very soon}
14...Qe8?! {Looks like a slight error on Black's part. 14...Nb6 was better in my opinion as the Knight would have made the life of the c7 pawn much easier}
15.b4 {Adding more control over the c5 square.White wants to increase control over the Queenside as Black looks to untangle his pieces}
15...Nd5 {Attacking the b4 pawn. 15...Nb8 followed by ...Nc6 to eliminate the Bishop on a5 was perhaps more accurate}

7.c5 {White closes the pawn chain as exchanging pawns does no good for White}
7...Nbd7 {Prepares ...e5 to attack White's advanced pawns on the dark central squares.This idea is copied from the advanced variation of the
French defence.Another idea for Black is to play 7...a5. Now if White plays 8.a4 to undermine's Black's pawn structure then 8...b4 allows Black to
close the pawn chain. 7...a5 seems to be a waste of time as Black can look forward to develop pieces instead of dancing to White's music.}

White to increase his space advantage. 9...c6 challenging White's imposing central pawn structure.

15.Bxe4 {15.Ne5 Nxd2 16.Qxd2 Nxe5 17.dxe5 Bxe5 18.Bxe5 Qxe5 leads to an equal position}
15...fxe4 16.Ne5 {White breaks up Black's pawn structure and puts the Knight in a position where it is difficult for Black to continue the attack}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 {White wants to avoid the Nimzo Indian after 3.Nc3 Bb4}
3...d5 {The Catalan}
4.Nf3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Be7 {Black wants to keep the Bishop pair. The White Bishop on d2 is misplaced}
6.Bg2 Nbd7 {More development as Black refuses to grab the c4 pawn and give up the central d-pawn}
7.O-O O-O {Both sides prefer development and no pawn initiatives again}
8.Qc2 {White would like to play e4 at some point.}
8...c6 9.Bf4 {Vacating the d2 square for the Knight as the Bishop on d2 is a hindrance.White's idea is to play cxd5 and then play Rac1 or Rfc1 to add
more pressure on the c-file. The Bishop on f4 guards the c7 square and White hopes to play Bc7 as well to throttle Black's Queen and hinder
development.}
9...b6 {The idea is to play ...Ba6 or ...Bb7 followed by ...Rc8}
10.cxd5 {White wants to dominate the c-file by playing Rc1 and Bc7 depending upon Black's responses}
10...cxd5 11.Rc1 Bb7 12.Bc7 {Black is cramped for space} 12...Qe8 13.Qb3 {...Rc8 will pin the Bishop on c7. The Queen goes to a safer square}
13...Rc8 {Activating the Rook }
14.Na3 {Nb5-Nd6 is the threat to choke Black's pieces.Also connects the Rooks }
14...Ne4 {...Ndf6 is a possible move to free space for the Black pieces}
15.Nb5 {According to the plan}
15...Ndc5 {Offering to sacrifice the Knight and also attacking the Queen.}
16.dxc5 bxc5 {The Bishop on c7 is cutoff from the Rook on c1}
17.Bf4 c4 {Attacking the Queen and forcing White to make a decision}
18.Qa4 {Forced or Black will win the Knight on b5}
18...Bc5 19.Be3 {Protecting the f2 pawn} Bc6 {Pinning the hapless Knight and Black will equalise} 20.Nfd4 Bxd4

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.g3 c6 4.Bg2 d5 {Neo-Grunfeld} 5.Nf3 dxc4 {Black is ready to play ...b5 and protect the extra pawn}
6.a4 {Preventing ...b5}
6...Ne4 {With an idea of playing ...Nd6 to add more protection to the pawn on c4 }
7.O-O {White goes for development}
7...Bg7 {Of course ...Nd6 is premature as White has yet not revelaed his cards and Black too develops a piece}
8.Nc3 {Challenging the Knight.Would you like to go to d6 or exchange?}
8...Nd6 {Black goes with the defense of the c4 pawn. The Knight has jumped three times since the first move. Black has an extra pawn but White
has the advantage of development.Now White needs to ascertain that he grabs more space in the centre and increases the advantage further.}
9.h3 {The g4 square is now under White's control. Black could have played ...Bg4 followed by ...Qc8 to control the h3-c8 diagonal. This would have given Black sound
positional control.White could have also gone straight for 9.e4 Bg4 10.Be3 Qc8 where the position is almost equal
9.e4 is also playable but 9...Bg4 10.Be3 Qc8 gives Black sufficient counterplay as ...Bh3 is unstoppable. Neutralising the light-squared Bishop means
Black extra pawn advantage becomes more potent.}
9...O-O 10.e4 {Now e4 makes more sense as the light square Bishop on c8 lacks space to develop on a good square. The f5 square is under White's firm grip}
10...Na6 {Black wants to plant the Knight on b4 - a hole created by White's advanced pawns. ...Nd3 is also an idea to cement the Knight in White's throat}
11.e5 {White wants to cash the positional advantage.}
11...Ne8 12.Qe2 {White Queen wants to grab the pawn} 12...Nb4 {Black plants the Knight in the hole.}13.Qxc4 {No ...Nd3 ideas here}
13...a5 {Cementing the Knight on b4}
14.Qe2 {The Queen has nothing to do on c4 and comes back on e2. Black wants to play ...Bf5 followed by ...Nd3.
White wants to play Rd1 followed by Be3 to obtain a good position.
14.Be3 is also playable but 14...Nc2 15.Rd1 Nxe3 16.fxe3 gives White a bad pawn structure.
The Queen on e2 does not allow ...Nc2 and White can play Be3 soon.}
14...b6 {15...Ba6 is the idea}
15.Re1 Nc7 {...Nd5 is an idea where Black looks more interested to exchange pieces}
16.Be3 {17.Qd2 and White is ready to play Bh6 soon}
16...Rb8 17.Na2 Ba6 18.Qd2 Nxa2 19.Rxa2 Bc4 20.Ra3 Bd5 21.h4 Qd7 22.Ng5 Bxg2 23.Kxg2 Qd5+ 24.Kg1 Bh6
