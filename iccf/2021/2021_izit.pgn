1.e4 {The King pawn opening. Arguably the most popular opening}
1...g6 {Black wants to play the Modern defence}
2.d4 {Grabbing the centre, White expands his pawn prowess}
2...Bg7 {The Bishop will eye the long-dark diagonal}
3.Nc3 {Adding more steel to the d5 square.}
3...d6 {Preventing White from pushing e5. If White succeeds in pushing the e5 pawn then Black will run into serious problems}
4.Be3 {Nice developing move that also adds more control over the c5 square. Black cannot play ...c5 easily.4.Bg5 looks an aggressive option but this
does lose control over the e5 square. The Bishop looks better on e3.}
4...a6!? {An interesting move. This moves prepares ...b5 followed by ...Bb7. Black intends to play ...b4 at some point to attack the
defender of the e4 pawn}
5.Qd2 {A principled move that prepares O-O-O. This moves also instills a confusion in Black's thinking...Should I play ...Nf6 or not?}
5...b5 {Black goes ahead with the plan. ...Bb7 is on the cards.The only problem with Black is that only pawn moves seem to be on the menu}
6.f3* {A prophylactic move to counter ...Bb7. White also takes advantage of the fact that Black is yet to develop the Kingside and prepares g4-h4 in the future}

1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.g3 {White wants to avoid the Nimzo Indian after 3.Nc3 Bb4}
3...d5 {The Catalan}
4.Nf3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Be7 {Black wants to keep the Bishop pair. The White Bishop on d2 is misplaced}
6.Bg2 Nbd7 {More development as Black refuses to grab the c4 pawn and give up the central d-pawn}
7.O-O*
