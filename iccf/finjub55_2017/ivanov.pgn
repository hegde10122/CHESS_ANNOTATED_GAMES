1. e4 Nf6{The Alekhine's defence which is a provocative attempt by Black to tempt
White into forming a broad pawn centre with plans to undermine it by his own pieces.}
2.e5 Nd5 {Black allows White to chase his knight to attain the aforementioned setup.Note that 
both players have moved the same piece twice which is a sharp refutation of the 
classical principles of chess openings.This defence is a hypermodern way of playing
fighting chess.}
3.d4 d6 {Black cannot allow White to run away with
centre control as the e5 pawn will act as a painful thorn.This pain needs to be addressed quickly.}
4.c4 Nb6 {White is determined to form a broad centre and Black obliges, 
only to strike back later.}
5. f4 {The four pawns attack in the Alekhine defence.}
5...g6{Black aims to fianchetto his dark-squared bishop and then pressurize the 
e5 and d4 squares.Note that Black has not made any attempt so far to occupy the 
centre with his pawns.}
6.Nc3 Bg7 {White has a cunning plan of developing his queen side
pieces followed by an outright attack on the black king after castling queen-side. Black develops a piece and aims to castle 
on the king-side.}
7.Be3{ White continues with his plan and generates two threats. The first one is h2-h4
with a kingside attack after castling long and the second one is to play c4-c5 and drive}
the Alekhine knight back which squeezes Black.}

7...Be6!{The best move that thwarts the c5 advance because if now 8.c5 then the 
knight can go to d5 and centralise itself.}

8.Nf3 {White lets off the steam and allows
Black some breathing space.The sharpest continuation would have been 8.d5 which kicks the
bishop again.}
8...O-O{Black completes his kingside development and now threatens the 
c4 pawn}
9.Qb3 {This move prevents Black's attempt to }

9...a5! {The Larsen counter-attack that attempts to deflect the White Queen}
10.a4 {This defensive move by White allows a hole on b4 that can be occupied by 
the Black knight}
10...Na6 {piece development with an eye on the b4 square}
11.Be2 {What are Black's options here,one may ask? 11...Nb4 looks to be a natural continuation
but is refuted by 12.Na2 with an intention of trading the knights.If black accepts
the exchange of horses then the all too familiar question 'what next?' crops up again.
Another closer look at the position tells us that White queen at b3
can now support the d5 pawn push and when Black pushes the bishop to f5
or c8 then the White pawn push e6 is annoying for Black}11...d5 {
Black himself occupies the d5 square }
