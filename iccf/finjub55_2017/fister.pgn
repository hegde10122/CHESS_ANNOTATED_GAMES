1.d4 f5 {The Dutch defence.Black stakes a claim to the central e4 square and plans a kingside offensive
later.However black weakens the h5-e8 diagonal which results in an aggressive and
unbalanced opening.}
2.g3 {White plans to fianchetto his king's bishop and add pressure
to the e4 and d5 squares. It also prevents black from fianchettoing 
the light squared bishop on c8. This bishop has got some problems
developing in this sort of a setup.}
2...Nf6 {The battle for the e4 and d5 squares has begun}
3.Bg2 e6
{This is the classical Dutch with an intention of 
developing the dark-squared bishop}
4.c4 Be7 
5.Nf3 O-O {Normal development for both sides}
6.O-O d6 {The Ilyinâ€“Zhenevsky System and the main line in the classical Dutch}
7.Nc3 a5 {
A strategic waiting move in this system that aims for controlling the b4 square which can act 
as outpost for the knight after it moves from b8 to c6 and then to b4. This is also called
Simagin variation. The b4 square can also be occupied by the black bishop in the future.
}
8. b3 {The main variation here where white decides to fianchetto his dark squared bishop
and control the e5 square from b2. The knight on f3 is also adding more pressure on the e5
square.}
8...Ne4 {Black decides to ease the cramp in his position. This move also halts the 
white idea of pushing e4 for the moment. White's primary idea in such positions 
will be to push e4 at the opportune moment.Black's attempt will be thwart this 
attempt and himself playing e5 to fight for central control.}
9.Bb2 Nxc3 10.Bxc3
{The exchange of knights eases Black's cramp}

10...Qe8 {Black's queen will go to h5 or g6 and launch a king-side offensive in the middlegame.This queen also will help Black's pursuit
of playing e5 in the middlegame and gain equality.}

11.a4 {Not the brightest of moves
by white in the position.Instead white must play to acquire the e4 square and
then play for a queen side expansion. This move fixes the a5 pawn of black.
I suspect Black will now either play Qe1 or Qd2 to attack the pawn further.}
11...b6!{Black
decides to throttle the idea immediately. Black will also fianchetto the light-
squared bishop. }
12.Ne1 {Attacks the rook on a8 and possibly preparing Nd3 followed by f4 with more control on the 
e5 square.}
12...Ra7{Black also prepares to play Bb7 and neutralise the ligh-squared
bishop's activity from g2}
13.e4 {Immediately solidifying the control over the central
squares.}
13...fxe4 
14.Bxe4{Black cannot allow White to push e5 and hence the exchange
of pawns was essential}
14...Bb7{As per the plan on the previous move which forces the
exchange of bishops}
15.Bxb7 Rxb7 
16.f4 Bf6{White seizes control over the e5 square
and Black immediately challenges it with the dark-squared bishop.It must be noted that the 
pawn on e6 is weak for Black and lies on a half-open e-file which prompts White to go for the
knight move now.}
17.Nf3 {Planning Ng5 and pressurising the pawn on e6. White's major
pieces will try to collar the e6 pawn}
17...c5 {Immediately challenging White's central
influence. The d4 pawn is pinned}
18. Qd3 {The queen protects the bishop on c3 and is 
preparing Qe4 in the future.}
18...Nc6{Developing the last piece and adding more pressure on the 
d4 square.}
19.Rad1{The rook adds more steel to the d4 square}
19...Re7{The rook which 
was doing nothing on the b7 square now comes to the aid of the pawn on e6 and prepares
for an e5 pawn push. If Black were to achieve this pawn push then the game would be
pretty much equal}
20.Rfe1{White now starts his plan of attacking the pawn on e6}
20...Nb4{Black puts his knight on the outpost with a tempo on the queen.Also Black 
is urging White to exchange the dark-squared bishop which will reduce an important
attacker of the e5 square.}
21.Bxb4 cxb4{White obliges and Black recaptures with the 
pawn on c5.If 21...axb4? then 22.dxc5 dxc5 23.Qd6 allows White to own the d-file and 
screw Black's pawn on e6. This would result in a collapse of Black's position.}
22.Kg2 {A waiting move by White}
22...g6{Another move worth considering for Black is 22...Qh5.This queen move allows the 
control of the fifth rank. The move that was played in the game
allows the king a vacant square on g7 after leaving the vulnerable d5-g8 diagonal.
It is clear that White will push d5 after solidifying his grip on the e-file}

23.Re2 {According to the plan of suffocating the e6 pawn}
23...Kg7{Black follows-up with his last move}
24.Rde1 {White follows-up too with the idea of piling more pressure on the e6 pawn}
24...Qd7 {Black adds protection to the e6 pawn and also vacates the e8 square
for the rook on f8.}
25.d5 {White attacks the pawn as the forces are ready for action.}
25...Rfe8 {Black adds more protection.Forced}
26.Re4 {A waiting move as the Queen also supports the rook. This is in anticipation 
of an exchange that actually happens in the next 3 moves.}
26...exd5 {Black exchanges as it is time for opening up the file}
27.Qxd5 Rxe4 28.Rxe4 Rxe4 29.Qxe4 {After this series of exchanges, let us review the
situation again. Black has weaknesses in his pawn-structure because of the double pawns 
on the b-file. The d6 pawn is now isolated.The positional asset for Black seems to 
be the long-ranged bishop against the white knight.White will now look to centralise 
his king while Black will have to stubbornly defend to force a draw. Black will try to 
penetrate White's king-side and harass the king.White thus has a slight edge}
29...Qc8 {Black is looking to generate some counterplay by moving to ...Qc5 or ...Qg4 as soon as White starts to centralise his King and Knight}
30.h3 {A prophylactic move that does not allow Black to play ...Qg4 and infiltrate the kingside.
White is perhaps planning to push g4 as well and utilise his 3-2 pawn majority on the kingside}
30...h5 {Black does not allow g4}
31.Nd2 {Activating the knight to centralise it to the e4 square. This Knight will come in handy to attack the pawns on the b-file.}
31...Qf5 {Offering a trade of queens}
32.Qb7+ {The best move in the circumstances according to the eyes of the "engine".The exchange of queens helps 
Black to obtain an easy draw}
32...Kf8 {Black moves to a safe square with the aim of moving towards the e-file and slowly march down towards the centre}
33.Ne4 Be7 {White centralises the knight with an attack on the isolated d6 pawn and Black defends the pawn}
34.Qd5 {With the knight now centralised, White offers an exchange of Queens.If Black were to play 34...Qxd5 35.cxd5 then the 
pawn on d5 acts a wedge that prevents Black king from centralising itself. In that case, White will use the 3-2 
pawn majority on the kingside and exchange off both the Black pawns.This gives White a decisive advantage}
34...Ke8 {Black king now enters the e-file with the hope of centralising itself.If Black's king manages to 
centralise then with accurate play on both sides the game will fizzle out to a draw.}
35.Nf2!! {A brilliant move that wins atleast a pawn for White.Black cannot afford to exchange Queens as the White pawn on d5 
acts as a wedge against the Black King.Meanwhile,White can easily centralise his king and attack Black's weak pawns on the 
queenside}
35...Qf6 {35...Qxf5 36.cxd5 37.Nd1 Kd7 38.Ne3 38.Bf6 Kc7 and Black's bishop is hemmed in because of his own pawns while
White enjoys a comfortable 3-2 pawn majority on the kingside that is good enough for a win.White's knight is more 
powerful than the Black bishop in this position.39.Nc4 decides the game in White's favour.}
36.Qc6+ {White wins a pawn with this check}
36...Kf7 {36...Kf8 is also okay}
37.Qxb6 Qb2 {Black is looking for some counter-play}
38.Qxa5 Qxb3 {Black also grabs a pawn.This position is still better for White.Probably winning}
39.Qd5+ {Black was threatening Qxc4.This moves prevents it and also prepares the pawn push 40.a5}
39...Kf8 {Black keeps the king on the dark square.}
40.f5 gxf5 41.Qxf5+ Kg7 42.Qd7 Kf7 43.Qb5 Bf6 44.Qxh5+ Ke7 45.Qh7+

61...dxc5 62.Qxc5+ Ke8 63.Qe5+ Kd8 64.Qd6+ Ke8 65.Qe6+ Kd8 66.Ne5 {Threating Qd7# on the next move}
66...Qd1 {The mate on d7 is averted}
67.h4 {Pushing the passed pawn}
67...Kc7 68.Qc4+ Kb7
69.Nb3 {Black resigned as the pawn on b3 will fall soon}1-0

2.e5 Nd5 {White attacks the knight, expands in the centre and Black responds by putting the knight on one of the central 
squares}
3.d4 d6 {White is pragmatic and looks to occupy the centre while Black attacks the advanced pawn staking his own claim to the centre}
4.Nf3 {The best move that starts the Modern Variation in this defence}
4..dxe5 {Black removes the wedge pawn}
