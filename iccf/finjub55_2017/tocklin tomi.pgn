1.e4 {The most popular opening move - the king's pawn opening}
1...c6 {The beginning of the Caro-Kann defence. It is a solid semi-open game like the 
French defence or the Sicilian defence that is considered to have better end games 
for Black due to the pawn structure}
2.d4 d5 {
White immediately seizes the opportunity to occupy the centre with both the central 
pawns and Black challenges White's centre-control with his own pawn push to d5.
}
3.e5 {The Advance variation where White expands in the centre and gains space}
3...c5!? {An important opening novelty that goes against the most popular move 3...Bf5
In the Caro-kann, Black brings out his light-squared bishop early and looks to dominate the 
light squares. But in the variation played in the game 
which is also called Botvinnikâ€“Carls Defense,
Black is trying to attack the base of the White's pawn chain. Here Black has already 
moved his c-pawn twice and is a tempo down when we compare these moves with the 
Advanced variation of the French defence.}
4.dxc5 {The best move for White according to modern-day analysis.White not only captures the 
pawn but will also try hard to disallow Black from getting back the extra pawn.
The downside of this move is that White has broken his own pawn chain and the 
pawn on e5 has become weak. Black will now try to exploit these pawn weaknesses to 
attain equality.}
4...Nc6 {A developing move that adds pressure on the e5 pawn.}
5.Nf3 {White too develops and adds support to the e5 pawn.}
5...Bg4 {This moves pins the White knight and threatens the pawn again on e5.}
6.Bb5 {White is aiming to inflicit structural damage to the Black's pawn structure and 
also neutralises the pressure on the e5 pawn.}
6...Qa5+ {Black threatens to capture the light-sqaured bishop with this important check.
The battle for the centre-control has gathered steam.}
7.Nc3 {Forced. Development that blocks the check and supports the light-squared bishop.}
7...e6 {A logical move that threatens the development of the dark-squared bishop by 8...Bxc5}
8.Be3 {White not only develops a piece but also makes it harder for Black to 
complete his king-side development.Black's knight on g8 also cannot develop to the 
most natural square on f6 on account of the White pawn wedge on e5}
8...Nge7 {An  important developing move that disallows White from inflicting damage to the 
pawn structure after 9.Bxc6.This knight can also jump to g6 and add more pressure on the 
e5 pawn.}
9.a3 {White is now building up a chain of moves that are aiming for a pawn expansion on the 
queen-side.} 
9...O-O-O {Black neglects White's move 10.b4 and instead aims to complete his development.
The position is equal and White's extra pawn on c5 is still not useful to give him
any decent advantage.}
10.b4 {White not only adds more protection to the c5 pawn but also aims for a 
queen-side expansion. White also aims to pen lines against an attack on the Black king-side
although this is easier said than done. Black has a solid position and his development
has been pretty good so far.}
10...Bxf3 {Black captures the knight and removes the defender of the e5 pawn.}
11.gxf3 {Only move. Not 11.Qxf3? 11...Nxb4! 12.O-O Nxc2 13. Rc1 Qxc3 14. Ba4 and Black has the advantage}
11...Qc7 {Black protects the Queen and also eyes the white pawn on e5}
12.Bxc6 {White exchanges the light-squared bishop as it has little scope on the light squares that are in Black's firm grip. }
12...Nxc6{Black brings the other knight to keep up the pressure on the e5 pawn}
13.Bf4 {White supports the e5 pawn}
13...a6{This pawn push guards the b5 square and ends White's hopes of getting the knight on b5 followed by Nd6
where Black's defence will become difficult.}
14.Bg3 {Here White vacates the f4 square for an f2-f4 push}
14...g5 {Black prevents f4 and vacates the g7 square for the dark-squared bishop on f8}
15.h4 {White immediately challenges the black pawn and asks a question}
15...Bg7 {Black carries out his plan of adding another attacker to the White pawn on e5}
16.hxg5 {White grabs the pawn on g5 and maintains a slight edge}
16...Bxe5 {Black at last succeeds in his plan of grabbing the e5 pawn. This was the positional struggle which Black had 
carried out since White had played 4.dxc5.
At this point it is important to note that although White has an extra pawn, his 
pawn structure is not too great and the position is fairly equal. }
17.Ne2 {White adds more support to the dark-squared bishop by re-directing his knight.This knight has very little to do on the 
c3.Here Black cannot capture 17...Bxa1?? 18.Bxc7 wins the game for White}
17...f6 {Black's intention is to keep exchanging White's advanced pawn.This position is too drawish now as both sides have 
played with too much caution.}
18.gxf6 {}
18...h5
19.Rb1 h4 20.Bxe5 Qxe5 {Exchange of the bishops}
21.f4 Qxf6 {Black regains one of the pawns back}
22.a4 e5 *{The game is extremely drawish in nature}
