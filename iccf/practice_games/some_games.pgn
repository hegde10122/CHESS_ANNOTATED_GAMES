1.d4 {White begins with the Queen pawn opening and controls the e5 central square. The c5 square - a part of the accelerated centre is also 
controlled. Accelerated central squares are the c4,c5,d4,d5,e4,e5,f4 and f5 squares.}
1...d5 {Black controls the e4 and c4 squares with an identical Queen pawn opening for himself}
2.Bf4* {The London system where White is interested in developing the Bishop to an optimal square eyeing the e5-b8 diagonal.}

1.e4 {The most popular King pawn opening for White in classical chess.Here White opens up the f1-b5 diagonal for his 
light-squared Bishop on f1 and plans to develop the Knight on g1 to f3 followed by O-O to complete rapid development.
White also controls the d5 and f5 squares - a strategic idea in the opening.}
1...e5 {Black copies White's idea and looks to have an equal say in the central squares by controlling the d4 and f4 squares. This move 
also disallows White from playing 2.d4 that would allow White to put the two central pawns on ideal squares giving him a great 
space advantage.}
2.Nf3 {A solid move where White attacks the e5 pawn and wants Black to react to the immediate threat of 3.Nxe5 on the next move. 
It also controls the d4 square - an important strategic goal in the opening for White.}
2...Nc6 {Protecting the pawn and developing a piece. It is equally important for Black to follow the opening principles in chess - 
rapid development of pieces on optimal squares, centre control by pawns or pieces and castling the King.}
3.Bb5 {Another good move which leads to the Ruy Lopez opening or the Spanish opening. Here White has developed his Kingside pieces and 
is ready to play O-O next. The main idea is to put pressure on Black's Knight that protects the e5 pawn. White is renewing the 
threat of Nxe5 as well.The Ruy Lopez opening was created in the 16th century, and was named after Spanish priest Ruy Lopez de Segura.
White and Black will now fight to control the central squares by placing two pawns here - the main goal of the Ruy lopez opening.}
3...a6 {Black kicks the Bishop and asks him the obvious question - Do you want to exchange the Bishop for my Knight on c6 by playing
4.Bxc6? This move if played, damages the Black pawn structure but is not considered to be a great option for White because not only does 
he lose the Bishop pair but also wastes time by exchanging a good piece thereby losing a great protector of his own light squares.}
4.Ba4 {White maintains the pressure on the Knight on c6 by retreating to a safer square.}
4...Nf6 {Black counterattacks in the centre with the threat of 5...Nxe4. This is similar to White strategy of Nxe5.}
5.O-O {White need not worry about the pawn on e4. If 5...Nxe4 then 6.d4 is good for White. 
For example to continue further, 6...b5 7.Bb3 d5
8.dxe5 which allows White to regain the pawn. Black is behind in development and losing the initiative.
In this sequence if Black decides to retreat the Knight on e4 by playing 7...Nf6?? then White wins after 8.Nxe5 threatening the pawn on 
f7.
5.d3 is also playable but defeats the purpose of the main goal of this opening.
5.Nc3 blocks the c-pawn and prevents the plan of occupying the centre with c3 and d4.
5.Qe2 develops the queen and protects the pawn on e4. But this move would be against the general opening principles. A possible ...Nd4 
in the future would harass the White Queen on e2.
5.d4 would jeopardize White's play so far and would be in contradiction of his Bishop development on b5. This Bishop is now on a4 
serving a strategic purpose and 5.d4 would allow 5...exd4 which has reduced Black's headache on controlling the pawn on e5.
By castling the King White has attained another objective of the openings in chess - Protecting the King and also developing the Rook 
to the central file where it can assist to control the central squares.
}
5...Be7 {The closed system of the Spanish opening begins after this move. 5...Nxe4 leads to the open Sicilian system. This Knight 
capturing the pawn is also a good move but Black does not retain the advantage of the extra pawn without sacrificing development. 
By developing the Bishop on e7 Black has closed the e-file and renews the threat of 6...Nxe4.}
6.Re1 {Not only does White develop the Rook, but also protects the pawn on e4. White now has ideas of playing c3 and d4 which will allow
him to carry out the main goal of the Ruy Lopez - putting two central pawns on optimal squares. All the possible ways of protecting 
the e4 pawn on the earlier move are possible here but the Rook on e1 is considered best as White would retain a slight advantage 
after putting the pawns on c3 and d4 which would keep the pressure intact in the centre. Black's counterattack is thus nullified.}
6...b5 {Black eliminates the threat of 7.Bxc6 followed by 8.Nxe5 and expands on the Queenside.}
7.Bb3 {The Bishop nows eyes the pawn on f7 but remember that White played the Bishop moves thrice in the opening to carry out 
his strategy. This is not inferior at all. Black can now focus on developing his pieces and castle.}
7...d6 {Black overprotects the e5 pawn and opens up the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8.Black also opens up 
the possibility of ...Na5 on the next move to capture the Bishop on b3 - a nuisance for Black. Black has thus opened up two good 
possibilities for development and exchange of material to neutralize White's initiative. This move has led to the Chigorin variation of the 
closed Sicilian.}
