[Opening "Italian Game, Giuoco Piano"]
[Variation "Pianissimo"]

1.e4 e5 {Both sides push their King pawns to optimal squares and control the central squares - a key motif of opening chess}
2.Nf3 {Attacking the e5 pawn by developing the Knight.}
2...Nc6 {Developing the Knight anf protecting the central e5 pawn}
3.Bc4 {Eyeing the f7 pawn and looking for a possible Ng5 combination in the future}
3...Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano or the Italian opening. 
Here Black stops White from playing 4.Ng5 or else Black will have to set himself up for some attacking chess.}
4.c3 {White prepares the d4 pawn push. This will help White to occupy the centre with two central pawns by harassing the Bishop on c5}
4...Nf6 {Black does not worry about 5.d4 as 5...exd4 6.cxd4 Bb4+ 7.Bd2 Nxe4 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ Kf8 11.Qxb4+ equalises easily.
The move 7.Bd2 allowing 7...Nxe4 is harmless,in my opinion,if White finds the moves correctly}
5.d3 {White defends the pawn on e4.This leads to the Pianissimo variation}
5...a5 {Here the a7 square is vacated for the Bishop on c5. This is due to the fact that White retains the possibility of playing d4 
or even b4 at some point soon. The Bishop would be harassed and it is important for Black to keep his Bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal for 
strategic purposes as it eyes the f2 pawn. The move ...a5 is prophylactic in nature as it also prevents his plans of pushing b4,a4 and b5 or 
a5 to expand on the Queenside.White needs to find out some other plan to win the battle.}
6.O-O {Best continuation according to me for White}
6...d6 {6...O-O?! is not a good choice as 7.d4!? Bb6 8.dxe5 allows White to win a pawn. The move played adds more protection to the e5 
pawn and renders 7.d4 with no great advantage for White.}
7.Re1 {White develops the Rook because the Black King is still in the centre.}
7...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and preventing 8.d4. 7...O-O is also acceptable.1-0. Black loses on time}

3.d5 {White keeps the centre closed and expands.}
3...d6 {Black wants to have ...e5 soon to challenge White's expansion in the centre.The Bishop on f4 is also blunted to some extent.}
4.Nc3 {White does not play the usually seen c4 is Queen pawn opening setups. White wants to control the e4 square with the pawn next}
4...g6 {4...Qb6 5.e4!? Qxb2 6.Bd2 Qb6 and Black has wasted precious tempi to grab a pawn. 7.Rb1 Qd8 8.f4 and White will have great activity 
for the lost pawn.}
5.e4 {White carries out his plan and has an expanded centre. White should now look for active play on the Queenside as the central 
pawn complex and the dark-squared Bishop on f4 are eyeing on that side.}
5...Bg7 {Black continues to develop the Kingside pieces and will be content playing a closed pawn-structure game}
6.Nf3 {White too wants to develop the Kingside and follow suit}
6...O-O {Black is the first to finish casting and is ready for a struggle on the central squares with the Bishop on g7 as a primary player}
7.Be2 {7.Bd3 also looks okay. But Black has the potential ...a6,...b5 and ...c4 onslaught at his disposal that will drive the Bishop 
on d3 backwards.}
7...Nh5?! {This looks questionable in my opinion. Black puts his Knight as the aggressor attacking the London Bishop on f4.
7...a6 looks a better alternative preparing ...b5}
8.Bg5 {A provocative move asking Black whether he would risk damaging his pawn structure. The Bishop on g5 wants to ruffle feathers and 
nothing menacing}
8...f6 {Black kicks the Bishop away bit creates a weak e6 square}
9.Be3 {With the possibilities of Qd2 open White retreats to a safer square}
9...Bg4?! {Black develops yet another piece and probably would exchange the Knight on f3.But was that a good move. In my opinion 
Black should have challenged White's central pawn complex with 9...f5 which would have vacated the f6 square for the Knight on h5 }

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defense where Black keeps his options open by developing the Knight first and controls the e4 and d5 squares}
2.Bf4 {The London system where White is content developing a quiet positional structure for a possible onslaught later}
2...g6 {Black wants to control the e5 and d4 squares with the Bishop from g7}

10.O-O O-O 11.Nbd2 Nxg3 12.hxg3 Nd7 {Another piece eyeing the e5 square now}

17.Ra5 {With more pressure on the b5 pawn}
17...g4 {Black attacks the Knight forcing White to alter his Queenside interest for a while}
18.Nh4 {Here White Knight is ready for Nf5. The retreat to e1 is passive and renders the Rook on f1 to remain ineffective.
Black has the option of playing ...Nf6 or ...h5 to protect the g4 pawn.
18.Ne1 cxb4 19.cxb4 Bxd4 20.Rxb5 Rxb5 21.Bxb5 Nf6 with a better pawn structure for Black}
18...Nf6 {Protects the g4 pawn.Now Black is ready to play cxb4 or cxd4 on the next move. 
Let us see the options for White on move 19. 
Option 1: - 19.Nf5 to attack the Bishop on g7. 19...Bxf5 20.exf5 give another set of doubled pawns for White - a positional 
disadvantage. It also sounds illogical that White who was focusing on a minority attack on the Queenside has suddenly changed focus.
So this move is incoherent. Also after White's double pawns on move 20 Black can continue 20...cxb4 21.cxb4 Qc3! attacking both the 
b4 and d4 pawns. 22.Rxb5 Rxb5 23.Bxb5 Qxb4 24.Bd3 Qxd4 and Black has gobbled up an extra pawn.Black is clearly on the rise.
Option 2: - The above variation tells us that after the c-file is opened due to pawn exchanges, ...Qc3 for Black is excellent.
White cannot stop the pawn exchanges but can play Qb3 to control the c3 square and stop ...Qc3 for Black.
Option 3: - 19.Rxb5 or 19.Bxb5 also runs into the same pawn exchange followed  by ...Qc3 which is good for Black.}
19.Qb3{19.Qa1 also looks to be a good move in hindsight for White.}
19...c4 {Black closes the pawn structure}
20.Qc2 {Keeping an eye on the e4 square. a2 and b2 are not attractive squares for the White Queen, in my opinion.}
20...e5 {Thrust in the centre as the Queenside flank is closed.21...h5 is worth consideration}
21.d5 {The centre remains closed as well now. The Black Bishop on c8 does not have a healthy square as of now leading to a 
discord between its heavy pieces}
21...h5 22.Rfa1 Bh6 {With the pawn structure closed, all around Black begins a manoeuver}
23.Nf1 {Black was threatening to remove the defender of the e4 pawn}
23...Qb6 {Not allowing 24.Ne3}
24.Ra7 {Rook occupies the seventh rank}
24...Bg5 {The Bishop just steps forward. A waiting move}

[Opening "Ruy Lopez Closed"]
[Variation "Chigorin Defense"]

1.e4 {The most popular King pawn opening for White in classical chess.Here White opens up the f1-b5 diagonal for his 
light-squared Bishop on f1 and plans to develop the Knight on g1 to f3 followed by O-O to complete rapid development.
White also controls the d5 and f5 squares - a strategic idea in the opening.}
1...e5 {Black copies White's idea and looks to have an equal say in the central squares by controlling the d4 and f4 squares. This move 
also disallows White from playing 2.d4 that would allow White to put the two central pawns on ideal squares giving him a great 
space advantage.}
2.Nf3 {A solid move where White attacks the e5 pawn and wants Black to react to the immediate threat of 3.Nxe5 on the next move. 
It also controls the d4 square - an important strategic goal in the opening for White.}
2...Nc6 {Protecting the pawn and developing a piece. It is equally important for Black to follow the opening principles in chess - 
rapid development of pieces on optimal squares, centre control by pawns or pieces and castling the King.}
3.Bb5 {Another good move which leads to the Ruy Lopez opening or the Spanish opening. Here White has developed his Kingside pieces and 
is ready to play O-O next. The main idea is to put pressure on Black's Knight that protects the e5 pawn. White is renewing the 
threat of Nxe5 as well.The Ruy Lopez opening was created in the 16th century, and was named after Spanish priest Ruy Lopez de Segura.
White and Black will now fight to control the central squares by placing two pawns here - the main goal of the Ruy lopez opening.}
3...a6 {Black kicks the Bishop and asks him the obvious question - Do you want to exchange the Bishop for my Knight on c6 by playing
4.Bxc6? This move if played, damages the Black pawn structure but is not considered to be a great option for White because not only does 
he lose the Bishop pair but also wastes time by exchanging a good piece thereby losing a great protector of his own light squares.}
4.Ba4 {White maintains the pressure on the Knight on c6 by retreating to a safer square.}
4...Nf6 {Black counterattacks in the centre with the threat of 5...Nxe4. This is similar to White strategy of Nxe5.}
5.O-O {White need not worry about the pawn on e4. If 5...Nxe4 then 6.d4 is good for White. 
For example to continue further, 6...b5 7.Bb3 d5
8.dxe5 which allows White to regain the pawn. Black is behind in development and losing the initiative.
In this sequence if Black decides to retreat the Knight on e4 by playing 7...Nf6?? then White wins after 8.Nxe5 threatening the pawn on 
f7.
5.d3 is also playable but defeats the purpose of the main goal of this opening.
5.Nc3 blocks the c-pawn and prevents the plan of occupying the centre with c3 and d4.
5.Qe2 develops the queen and protects the pawn on e4. But this move would be against the general opening principles. A possible ...Nd4 
in the future would harass the White Queen on e2.
5.d4 would jeopardize White's play so far and would be in contradiction of his Bishop development on b5. This Bishop is now on a4 
serving a strategic purpose and 5.d4 would allow 5...exd4 which has reduced Black's headache on controlling the pawn on e5.
By castling the King White has attained another objective of the openings in chess - Protecting the King and also developing the Rook 
to the central file where it can assist to control the central squares.
}
5...Be7 {The closed system of the Spanish opening begins after this move. 5...Nxe4 leads to the open Sicilian system. This Knight 
capturing the pawn is also a good move but Black does not retain the advantage of the extra pawn without sacrificing development. 
By developing the Bishop on e7 Black has closed the e-file and renews the threat of 6...Nxe4.}
6.Re1 {Not only does White develop the Rook, but also protects the pawn on e4. White now has ideas of playing c3 and d4 which will allow
him to carry out the main goal of the Ruy Lopez - putting two central pawns on optimal squares. All the possible ways of protecting 
the e4 pawn on the earlier move are possible here but the Rook on e1 is considered best as White would retain a slight advantage 
after putting the pawns on c3 and d4 which would keep the pressure intact in the centre. Black's counterattack is thus nullified.}
6...b5 {Black eliminates the threat of 7.Bxc6 followed by 8.Nxe5 and expands on the Queenside.}
7.Bb3 {The Bishop nows eyes the pawn on f7 but remember that White played the Bishop moves thrice in the opening to carry out 
his strategy. This is not inferior at all. Black can now focus on developing his pieces and castle.}
7...d6 {Black overprotects the e5 pawn and opens up the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8.Black also opens up 
the possibility of ...Na5 on the next move to capture the Bishop on b3 - a nuisance for Black. Black has thus opened up two good 
possibilities for development and exchange of material to neutralize White's initiative.}
8.c3 {Black vacates the c2 square for the Bishop if Black plays 8...Na5. Also prepares for the d4 pawn push to complete the Spanish setup}
8...O-O {Black completes development of the Kingside}
9.h3 {White does not want Black to play 9...Bg4 which allows sufficient activity after the Knight on f3 is pinned.}
9...Na5 {Black wants the Bishop on b3 to retreat and go back to c2 where its efficacy is blunted by its own pawn on e4 - a slight 
strategical punch}
10.Bc2 {White wants to keep the Bishop pair and both the Bishops want to participate in a Kingside offensive in the future.}
10...c5 {To add more pressure on the d4 square}
11.d4 {White finally attains his objective of putting two pawns in the centre}
11...Qc7 {Black wants to keep his e5 pawn intact and adds another defender because the knight on c6 is now on a5}
12.Nbd2 {White now wants to develop his Queenside and starts with the Knight. In the long term, White would love to take this Knight 
on d2 to f5 via the d2-f1-g3-f5 route where he can press for a Kingside attack.}
12...Bd7 {Connecting the Rooks as 12...Bd7 allows White the possibilities of pushing d5 and curtailing the light-squared Bishop's activity.
Black's Knight on a5 is also a problem now as it needs to be brought back to action.}
13.Nf1 {White wants to plant the Knight on d5 via the f1-e3-d5 route which will allow him a great position.}
13...Nc4!? {The Knight covers the e3 square and can now come back to b6. Black can also aim to expand further on the Queenside 
in the future with ...a5 and ...a4. This Knight move has vacated the a5 square for the pawn on a7.}
14.Ng3 {White wants to play Nf5 next}
14...Rfc8 {This move indirectly attacks the Bishop on c2. White has no time for 15.Nf5? cxd4! 16.cxd4 Nxb2! 17.Bxb2 Qxc2 with a great
position}
15.d5 {Cutting out the option ...cxd4 and gaining space in the centre}
15...Nb6 {The Knight retreats as the pawn structure is closed}
16.Be3 {White does not play 16.Nf5 as 16...Bxf5 17.exf5 destroys White pawn structure in the centre. After having pushed d5 
White wants to enjoy space advantage. The move played is flexible and wants Black to jump the gun}
16...Nc4 {This moves attacks the Bishop on e3 and the b2 pawn.
16...g6 cutting off Nf5 ideas is also a good continuation.White now needs to change the plan as Black awaits.}
17.Bc1 {Protecting the b2 pawn and White needs to step back here}
17...Rcb8 {Now Black wants to expand on the Queenside starting with ...a5. Both the Rooks are well placed behind the flank pawns}
18.b3 {White kicks the Knight away as his position is passive.18.Nd2 followed by f4 would have been a better attempt to gain 
initiative}
18...Nb6 19.Be3 c4 {Black gets to expand on the Queenside}
20.b4 {White closes the Queenside pawn structure as well}
20...a5 {Expanding on the Queenside further}
21.a3 Ra6 {Looking to double the Rooks on the a-file and then capture axb4}
22.Qe2 {Throttled White, connects the Rook}
22...Rba8 {Increasing the pressure on the a-file. Black can go for some simplification}
23.Qf1 {White perhaps is planning for Nd2 followed by f4}
23...h6 {Black plays a waiting move and rejects White's draw offer}

White cannot afford to play a timid move like 10.Be2 followed by O-O. Black's light-squared pawn complex with the head on c4 is a

1.e4 c5 {Black replies with the Sicilian defense - a highly explored opening for Black with too many variations.}
2.Nc3 {White does not play 2.Nf3 but opts for the closed Sicilian.}
2...g6 {Black wants to commit with the Dragon Bishop on g7 and eye the d4 and e5 squares.This is a sharp line with attacking 
possibilities for both sides.}
3.d4 {White challenges the centre. 3.g3 followed by Bg2 is a good alternative leading to positional play.}
3...cxd4 {Black gets rid of the central pawn and now has a semi-open c-file with the possibility of ...Rc8 at some point soon.}
4.Qxd4 {Attacking the Rook on h8}
4...Nf6 {Black develops the Knight and blocks the threat}
5.Bg5 {An aggressive developing move looking to crush Black}
5...Nc6 {Black develops the Knight with tempo}
6.Qd2 {Forming the Queen-Bishop battery on the h6-c1 diagonal. White's idea is simple - Get the Bishop on g7 with Bh6 and try to 
exchange it off to weaken the Black Kingside}
6...Bg7 {The dragon Bishop is out to take care of matters and Black is ready to tuck away the King by O-O}
7.f3!? {An interesting move. White wants to play g4,h4 for a Kingside attack but at the same time does not want to give away the 
g4 square for a possible ...Ng4. White is anticipating that Black might push ...h6 and hence cushions the e3 square for the Bishop on g5 
by playing f3.}
7...Qa5 {The Queen is out as it anticipates White to play O-O-O. 7...O-O is risky as 8.h4 followed by h5 and a possible Nd5 to 
pressurise the Knight on f6 are on the cards. White is quite smart with his moves so far.}
8.Bc4 {An excellent square for the Bishop that puts pressure on the f7 pawn}
8...Rb8  {Black wants to expand on the Queenside with ...b5 anticipating O-O-O from White}
9.O-O-O {9.Bb3 was better}

being proactive}
10.Bb3 b4{Black presses further}
11.Nd5 Nxd5 {Trading pieces helps Black here}
12.Bxd5 {12.Qxd5 Qxd5 is a better option for White. Now the Bishop can be kicked back with Black's next move}
12...e6 13.Bxc6 O-O {13...dxc6?? 14.Qd8+ Qxd8 15.Rxd8# 
13...Qe5? fails to 14.Bxd7+ Kf8 15.Qd6+ and the Black Queen has to be traded.

1.d4 d6 {White was actually thinking of playing 2.Bf4 and 
get into a London system. But this move actually tells us that the Bishop on f4 for White may not be an attractive piece as it's activity looks tamed}
2.e4 {Better to capture the centre}

3.Nc3 {Developing the Knight to control the d5 square}
3...Bg7 4.Be3 {The Bishop looks good here as White can setup long castling with Qd2 and a possible Bh6 later to infiltrate on the Kingside}
4...Nf6 {Black prepares castling}
5.f3 {The g4 square is taken away from the Knight as White wants to play O-O-O and then launch a Kingside offensive with h4,g4 etc.}
5...O-O 6.Qd2 {White too is looking to castle but on the opposite Queenside}
5...c6 {Black prepares ...b5 but safeguards the b5 square such that White does not play Nb5 and also n=Nd5 in the near future.}
6.g4 {White starts the pawn storm on the Kingside. It is important to not allow Black to push ...h5. So h4 is not okay but the 
move played is better. 
6.a4 A prophylactic move to prevent Black from pushing ...b5. 
This move is not good as it is too slow allowing Black to play in the centre. White must refrain from playing on both sides of the 
board. 6...e5 threatening ...exd4 and not allowing White from playing Bh6. }
6...Qc7 {Possible idea is to push ...e5 and play in the centre}
7.O-O-O {7.Bh6  --- Looking to exchange Black's strong piece and create dark-squared weaknesses 
around the Black King is a playable alternative}
7...e5 {Playing in the centre}
8.Nge2 {Protecting the d4 pawn so that Bxd4 is avoided if Black captures the pawn. Bh6 is the goal for White here.
8.g5 looks more ambitious though. 
This move allows 8...exd4 9.Bxd4 Ne8 10.Bxg7 Nxg7 11.Nge2 Nd7 and Black still has issues with development on the

tremendous scope for attacking play.Although it looks playable after 9...Ne7 10.Re1 Here White has forced Black's Kingside

14...Qf6 {Now why such a move that X-rays your own Queen against the Bishop on b2 - you might ask? 
This move is actually quite harmless as 15.Rfe1 Rfe8 which begins the skirmish for the e5 pawn. 16.d4 e4! 17.d5!

9...dxc4 {Black grabs the pawn on offer but gives up the central d5 square.}

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4  {The Columbus variation}
4...Nf6
5.Qe2 {The Wormald attack}
5...b5 6.Bb3 6...Bc5 {Theory at its best}
7.d3 h6 {Not allowing 8.Bg5}
8.c3 {I feel this is a passive move. O-O was better. Perhaps White was worried about 8...Nc5 and wanted to create an escape 
square for the Bishop on b3. Black's h6 move earlier seems to have created this response where White feels that his attacking chances 
are stymied.}
8...O-O {The g5 square cannot be used to pin the Knight on f6 and Black can now look forward to play on the Queenside depending on 
White's choices. }
9.Nbd2 {White plays a positional move and perhaps will transfer this Knight to g3 via f1}
9...Re8 {Black plans to play ...d6,...Be6. 9...Bb7 does not look sound as the d3-e4 pawn complex is a tough nail and the Bishop on b7 
will be biting granite and do nothing else. The Bishop on e6 would blunt the powerful White Bishop on b3 and this would reduce,in turn,
White's attacking prospects}

[Opening "Semi-Slav defense"]
[Variation "Anti-Moscow"]

1.d4 d5  {The Queen's pawn opening}
2.c4 {The Queen's gambit}
2...c6 {Slav defense}
3.Nf3 Nf6 {Opening theory where the Knights occupy the best squares and control key central squares.This is called the Modern line of 
the slav defense}
4.Nc3 {The three Knights variation of the Modern line}
4...e6 {The semi-slav defense where ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 remains a thematic idea}
5.Bg5 {White does not choose the theoretical 5.e3 which is more positional and blocks the Bishop on c1.
This is the Anti-Meran gambit }
5...h6 
6.Bh4 
6...dxc4 {White loses a pawn here but gets more central control now after the next move}
7.e4 {White occupies the centre and attacks the pawn on c4.This is the Anti-Moscow variation}
7...g5 {Forcing White to react instead of of Bxc4 } 
8.Bg3 b5 {The basic position where the game begins with Black being a pawn up but at the cost of advanced pawns on the Kingside}
9.Be2 {Another move from theory in this variation}
9...Bb7 {Black develops another piece and now the idea is to to play c5 or e5 later}
10.O-O Nbd7 {Since has castled short, Black could have also considered 10...Bb4 putting pressure on the protector of the e4 pawn
11.Ne5! Now if 11...Bxc3 12.bxc3 Nxe4? is bad for Black. 13.Bh5 forcing Black to play 13...O-O 14.Bxf7+ Rxf7 15.Nxf7 Kxf7 16.Qh5+ Ke7 
where Black's King is exposed and White has a good game. Black is already a pawn up and the greed of capturing another pawn is certainly 
painful.
Option 2: 10...Be7 where Black wants to play 11...O-O is met with 11.h4 Here again Black cannot castle as 12.hxg5 would compromise the 
pawn structure for Black. By keeping the Bishop on f8 Black is not playing his cards on the Kingside. Black develops his Queenside 
where he has an extra pawn forcing White to take risks for getting active play}

1.e4 e5 {The King's pawn opening where both players occupy the central e-file squares.}
2.Nf3 {Pressurises the e5 pawn with the best move possible}
2...Nc6 {This move develops the Knight and also defends the pawn on e5}
3.Bb5 {This starts the Ruy Lopez opening where the Spanish Bishop on b5 attacks the defender of the e5 pawn one more time}
3...a6 {The Morphy's defense where Black says - Common capture my Knight on c6. 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 Qd4 where Black wins back the pawn 
after 6.Nf3 Qxe4+}
4.Ba4 {The Columbus variation where White retains the Bishop pair}
4...Nf6 {Now Black wants to grab the e4 pawn with this active development of the Knight on f6}
5.O-O {White neglects the threat of 5...Nxe4 since 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 8.dxe5 wins back the pawn with more space advantage}
5...Be7 {This is the closed system of the Ruy lopez. Here the e-file is closed by the developed Bishop
 and Black has the option of ...Nxe4 on the next move}
6.Re1 b5 {The threat of Bxc6 is removed}
7.Bb3 d6 {Overprotecting the e5 pawn and Black is ready to play ...Bg4 }
8.a4 {Not effective as 8.c3 }
8...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and looking to play ...Nd4}
9.c3 {Creating an escape square c2 for the Bishop on b3. White is also ready to play d4 and occupy the central squares - a thematic idea 
in this Ruy Lopez}
9...O-O 10.h3 {The pin is uncomfortable and White wants the Bishop to be trade for the Knight}
10...Bh5 {10...Bxf3 will be good for White. The d4 square is not available for ...Nd4 idea after 11.Qxf3 }
11.d3 {White is now getting ready for Nbd2-f1-g3}
11...h6 {Preventing Bg5.Making it harder for White to develop minor pieces.White has to work hard for his dinner}
