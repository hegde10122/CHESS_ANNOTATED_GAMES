1.d4 d5 
2.Bf4 {The London system}
2...e6 {Black solidifies the centre but locks in the Bishop on c8}
3.e3 f5?! {In my opinion, this is not a good continuation as Black has weakened the Kingside.This is the Sarratt attack.Black is 
probably trying to set up a Dutch stonewall by playing c6,Be7,Nf6 and O-O. Black has clamped down on the e4 square after 3...f5}
4.c4 {Here White attacks the pawn chain and is ready to exchange cxd4 soon. White does not play Nf3 }
4...Nf6 5.Nc3 c6 {As guessed - the Dutch stonewall is coming up where the e5 square is a possible "hole" for Black and White 
needs to capitalise on that}
6.Bd3 {White does not play 6.Nf3 and keeps an eye on the h5 square to avert 6...Nh5}
6...Be7 {Black does not play ...Bd6 because it is only piece with authority to control the dark squares}
7.h3 {Vacating the h2 square for the Bishop on f4. Also taking away the g4 square from the Knight. In this Dutch setup, 
Black usually plays ...Qe8,followed by ...Qg6,...g5 and ...h5.So it is a preparatory move for the possible Black rampage on the Kingside }
7...O-O 8.Nf3 {Both sides develop their pieces}
8...Ne4 {The thematic Dutch move where Black occupies the e4 square with the Knight. Black's plan include...Nd7,Ndf6,g5,h5,Qe8,Qg6...
attack,attack and attack!!}
9.Rc1 {White wants to keeps things under wraps and does not castle.White can also play cxd5 soon and possibly exert some pressure along the 
c-file. Another important thing --- Black can also play 9...Nxc3 to simplify the position. 10.Rxc3 is a favourable way to capture the 
Knight back}
9...Nd7 {This Knight might appear on f6 for a Kingside offensive.}
10.Qc2 {Another move that adds more influence to the e4 square}
10...a5 {Black plays on the Queenside flank}
11.O-O {As Black does not seem committal towards a Kingside offensive, it is perhaps the right time to castle}
11...Qe8 {Black was waiting for White to castle and now takes a baby step towards the King on g1}
12.Nd2 {Since Black will now play on the Kingside, the Black Knight on e4 will play an important role. White wants to play f3 next and derail 
Black's plan.}
12...g5 {As expected,The Dutch attack has begun}
13.Bh2 {The importance of move 7 is now visible}
13...Qh5 {The Black Queen is out to checkmate the White King}
14.Ndxe4 {The point of move 12. The Knight on e4 must go}
14...fxe4 {Opening up the -file}
15.Be2 {The Bishop hits back at the Queen}
15...Qe8 16.f3! {The decisive pawn-break. White keeps asking questions and does not allow Black to coordinate his pieces}
16...exf3 17.Rxf3 {Asking for a Rook trade as well}
17...Rxf3 18.Bxf3 {Black's attack has been curbed decisively and he is left with undeveloped pieces}
18...Nf6 19.Rf1 {Both parties bring pieces to the Kingside as Black try to revive his failed bid earlier}
19...Bd7 {The 'pawn' Bishop is ready!!}
20.Be5 {Bringing another piece to a central square}
20...dxc4 {Black offers a draw here!!}
21.Ne4 {Attacking the g5 pawn and forcing Black to make another trade decision as far as the Knight on f6 is concerned}
21...Nxe4 22.Bxe4 {23.Bxh7# is on the cards}
22...Qh5 {Protecting the h7 pawn}
23.Bxh7+ {White goes for simplification and a superior end game. 23...Qxh7 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rf7+ is on the cards. Black resigned}

[Opening "Italian Game, Giuoco Piano"]
[Variation "Pianissimo"]

1.e4 e5 {Both sides push their King pawns to optimal squares and control the central squares - a key motif of opening chess}
2.Nf3 {Attacking the e5 pawn by developing the Knight.}
2...Nc6 {Developing the Knight anf protecting the central e5 pawn}
3.Bc4 {Eyeing the f7 pawn and looking for a possible Ng5 combination in the future}
3...Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano or the Italian opening. 
Here Black stops White from playing 4.Ng5 or else Black will have to set himself up for some attacking chess.}
4.c3 {White prepares the d4 pawn push. This will help White to occupy the centre with two central pawns by harassing the Bishop on c5}
4...Nf6 {Black does not worry about 5.d4 as 5...exd4 6.cxd4 Bb4+ 7.Bd2 Nxe4 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ Kf8 11.Qxb4+ equalises easily.
The move 7.Bd2 allowing 7...Nxe4 is harmless,in my opinion,if White finds the moves correctly}
5.d3 {White defends the pawn on e4.This leads to the Pianissimo variation}
5...a5 {Here the a7 square is vacated for the Bishop on c5. This is due to the fact that White retains the possibility of playing d4 
or even b4 at some point soon. The Bishop would be harassed and it is important for Black to keep his Bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal for 
strategic purposes as it eyes the f2 pawn. The move ...a5 is prophylactic in nature as it also prevents his plans of pushing b4,a4 and b5 or 
a5 to expand on the Queenside.White needs to find out some other plan to win the battle.}
6.O-O {Best continuation according to me for White}
6...d6 {6...O-O?! is not a good choice as 7.d4!? Bb6 8.dxe5 allows White to win a pawn. The move played adds more protection to the e5 
pawn and renders 7.d4 with no great advantage for White.}
7.Re1 {White develops the Rook because the Black King is still in the centre.}
7...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and preventing 8.d4. 7...O-O is also acceptable.1-0. Black loses on time}

Black has the option of playing ...Nf6 or ...h5 to protect the g4 pawn.
18.Ne1 cxb4 19.cxb4 Bxd4 20.Rxb5 Rxb5 21.Bxb5 Nf6 with a better pawn structure for Black}
18...Nf6 {Protects the g4 pawn.Now Black is ready to play cxb4 or cxd4 on the next move. 
Let us see the options for White on move 19. 
Option 1: - 19.Nf5 to attack the Bishop on g7. 19...Bxf5 20.exf5 give another set of doubled pawns for White - a positional 
disadvantage. It also sounds illogical that White who was focusing on a minority attack on the Queenside has suddenly changed focus.
So this move is incoherent. Also after White's double pawns on move 20 Black can continue 20...cxb4 21.cxb4 Qc3! attacking both the 
b4 and d4 pawns. 22.Rxb5 Rxb5 23.Bxb5 Qxb4 24.Bd3 Qxd4 and Black has gobbled up an extra pawn.Black is clearly on the rise.
Option 2: - The above variation tells us that after the c-file is opened due to pawn exchanges, ...Qc3 for Black is excellent.
White cannot stop the pawn exchanges but can play Qb3 to control the c3 square and stop ...Qc3 for Black.
Option 3: - 19.Rxb5 or 19.Bxb5 also runs into the same pawn exchange followed  by ...Qc3 which is good for Black.}
19.Qb3{19.Qa1 also looks to be a good move in hindsight for White.}
19...c4 {Black closes the pawn structure}
20.Qc2 {Keeping an eye on the e4 square. a2 and b2 are not attractive squares for the White Queen, in my opinion.}
21...e5 {Thrust in the centre as the Queenside flank is closed.21...h5 is worth consideration}
22.d5 {The centre remains closed as well now. The Black Bishop on c8 does not have a healthy square as of now leading to a 
discord between its heavy pieces}
22...h5 23.Rfa1 Bh6 {With the pawn structure closed, all around Black begins a manoeuver}
24.Nf1 {Black was threatening to remove the defender of the e4 pawn}
24...Qb6 {Not allowing 25.Ne3}
25.Ra7 {Rook occupies the seventh rank}
25...Bg5 {The Bishop just steps forward. A waiting move}

1.e4 {The most popular King pawn opening for White in classical chess.Here White opens up the f1-b5 diagonal for his 
light-squared Bishop on f1 and plans to develop the Knight on g1 to f3 followed by O-O to complete rapid development.
White also controls the d5 and f5 squares - a strategic idea in the opening.}
1...e5 {Black copies White's idea and looks to have an equal say in the central squares by controlling the d4 and f4 squares. This move 
also disallows White from playing 2.d4 that would allow White to put the two central pawns on ideal squares giving him a great 
space advantage.}
2.Nf3 {A solid move where White attacks the e5 pawn and wants Black to react to the immediate threat of 3.Nxe5 on the next move. 
It also controls the d4 square - an important strategic goal in the opening for White.}
2...Nc6 {Protecting the pawn and developing a piece. It is equally important for Black to follow the opening principles in chess - 
rapid development of pieces on optimal squares, centre control by pawns or pieces and castling the King.}
3.Bb5 {Another good move which leads to the Ruy Lopez opening or the Spanish opening. Here White has developed his Kingside pieces and 
is ready to play O-O next. The main idea is to put pressure on Black's Knight that protects the e5 pawn. White is renewing the 
threat of Nxe5 as well.The Ruy Lopez opening was created in the 16th century, and was named after Spanish priest Ruy Lopez de Segura.
White and Black will now fight to control the central squares by placing two pawns here - the main goal of the Ruy lopez opening.}
3...a6 {Black kicks the Bishop and asks him the obvious question - Do you want to exchange the Bishop for my Knight on c6 by playing
4.Bxc6? This move if played, damages the Black pawn structure but is not considered to be a great option for White because not only does 
he lose the Bishop pair but also wastes time by exchanging a good piece thereby losing a great protector of his own light squares.}
4.Ba4 {White maintains the pressure on the Knight on c6 by retreating to a safer square.}
4...Nf6 {Black counterattacks in the centre with the threat of 5...Nxe4. This is similar to White strategy of Nxe5.}
5.O-O {White need not worry about the pawn on e4. If 5...Nxe4 then 6.d4 is good for White. 
For example to continue further, 6...b5 7.Bb3 d5
8.dxe5 which allows White to regain the pawn. Black is behind in development and losing the initiative.
In this sequence if Black decides to retreat the Knight on e4 by playing 7...Nf6?? then White wins after 8.Nxe5 threatening the pawn on 
f7.
5.d3 is also playable but defeats the purpose of the main goal of this opening.
5.Nc3 blocks the c-pawn and prevents the plan of occupying the centre with c3 and d4.
5.Qe2 develops the queen and protects the pawn on e4. But this move would be against the general opening principles. A possible ...Nd4 
in the future would harass the White Queen on e2.
5.d4 would jeopardize White's play so far and would be in contradiction of his Bishop development on b5. This Bishop is now on a4 
serving a strategic purpose and 5.d4 would allow 5...exd4 which has reduced Black's headache on controlling the pawn on e5.
By castling the King White has attained another objective of the openings in chess - Protecting the King and also developing the Rook 
to the central file where it can assist to control the central squares.
}
5...Be7 {The closed system of the Spanish opening begins after this move. 5...Nxe4 leads to the open Sicilian system. This Knight 
capturing the pawn is also a good move but Black does not retain the advantage of the extra pawn without sacrificing development. 
By developing the Bishop on e7 Black has closed the e-file and renews the threat of 6...Nxe4.}
6.Re1 {Not only does White develop the Rook, but also protects the pawn on e4. White now has ideas of playing c3 and d4 which will allow
him to carry out the main goal of the Ruy Lopez - putting two central pawns on optimal squares. All the possible ways of protecting 
the e4 pawn on the earlier move are possible here but the Rook on e1 is considered best as White would retain a slight advantage 
after putting the pawns on c3 and d4 which would keep the pressure intact in the centre. Black's counterattack is thus nullified.}
6...b5 {Black eliminates the threat of 7.Bxc6 followed by 8.Nxe5 and expands on the Queenside.}
7.Bb3 {The Bishop nows eyes the pawn on f7 but remember that White played the Bishop moves thrice in the opening to carry out 
his strategy. This is not inferior at all. Black can now focus on developing his pieces and castle.}
7...d6 {Black overprotects the e5 pawn and opens up the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8.Black also opens up 
the possibility of ...Na5 on the next move to capture the Bishop on b3 - a nuisance for Black. Black has thus opened up two good 
possibilities for development and exchange of material to neutralize White's initiative.}
8.c3 {Black vacates the c2 square for the Bishop if Black plays 8...Na5. Also prepares for the d4 pawn push to complete the Spanish setup}
8...O-O {Black completes development of the Kingside}
9.h3 {White does not want Black to play 9...Bg4 which allows sufficient activity after the Knight on f3 is pinned.}
9...Na5 {Black wants the Bishop on b3 to retreat and go back to c2 where its efficacy is blunted by its own pawn on e4 - a slight 
strategical punch}
10.Bc2 {White wants to keep the Bishop pair and both the Bishops want to participate in a Kingside offensive in the future.}
10...c5 {To add more pressure on the d4 square}
11.d4 {White finally attains his objective of putting two pawns in the centre}
11...Qc7 {Black wants to keep his e5 pawn intact and adds another defender because the knight on c6 is now on a5}
12.Nbd2 {White now wants to develop his Queenside and starts with the Knight. In the long term, White would love to take this Knight 
on d2 to f5 via the d2-f1-g3-f5 route where he can press for a Kingside attack.}
12...Bd7 {Connecting the Rooks as 12...Bd7 allows White the possibilities of pushing d5 and curtailing the light-squared Bishop's activity.
Black's Knight on a5 is also a problem now as it needs to be brought back to action.}
13.Nf1 {White wants to plant the Knight on d5 via the f1-e3-d5 route which will allow him a great position.}
13...Nc4!? {The Knight covers the e3 square and can now come back to b6. Black can also aim to expand further on the Queenside 
in the future with ...a5 and ...a4. This Knight move has vacated the a5 square for the pawn on a7.}
14.Ng3 {White wants to play Nf5 next}
14...Rfc8 {This move indirectly attacks the Bishop on c2. White has no time for 15.Nf5? cxd4! 16.cxd4 Nxb2! 17.Bxb2 Qxc2 with a great
position}
15.d5 {Cutting out the option ...cxd4 and gaining space in the centre}
15...Nb6 {The Knight retreats as the pawn structure is closed}
16.Be3 {White does not play 16.Nf5 as 16...Bxf5 17.exf5 destroys White pawn structure in the centre. After having pushed d5 
White wants to enjoy space advantage. The move played is flexible and wants Black to jump the gun}
16...Nc4 {This moves attacks the Bishop on e3 and the b2 pawn.
16...g6 cutting off Nf5 ideas is also a good continuation.White now needs to change the plan as Black awaits.}
17.Bc1 {Protecting the b2 pawn and White needs to step back here}
17...Rcb8 {Now Black wants to expand on the Queenside starting with ...a5. Both the Rooks are well placed behind the flank pawns}
18.b3 {White kicks the Knight away as his position is passive.18.Nd2 followed by f4 would have been a better attempt to gain 
initiative}
18...Nb6 19.Be3 c4 {Black gets to expand on the Queenside}
20.b4 {White closes the Queenside pawn structure as well}

1.e4 c5 {Black replies with the Sicilian defense - a highly explored opening for Black with too many variations.}
2.Nc3 {White does not play 2.Nf3 but opts for the closed Sicilian.}
2...g6 {Black wants to commit with the Dragon Bishop on g7 and eye the d4 and e5 squares.This is a sharp line with attacking 
possibilities for both sides.}
3.d4 {White challenges the centre. 3.g3 followed by Bg2 is a good alternative leading to positional play.}
3...cxd4 {Black gets rid of the central pawn and now has a semi-open c-file with the possibility of ...Rc8 at some point soon.}
4.Qxd4 {Attacking the Rook on h8}
4...Nf6 {Black develops the Knight and blocks the threat}
5.Bg5 {An aggressive developing move looking to crush Black}
5...Nc6 {Black develops the Knight with tempo}
6.Qd2 {Forming the Queen-Bishop battery on the h6-c1 diagonal. White's idea is simple - Get the Bishop on g7 with Bh6 and try to 
exchange it off to weaken the Black Kingside}
6...Bg7 {The dragon Bishop is out to take care of matters and Black is ready to tuck away the King by O-O}
7.f3!? {An interesting move. White wants to play g4,h4 for a Kingside attack but at the same time does not want to give away the 
g4 square for a possible ...Ng4. White is anticipating that Black might push ...h6 and hence cushions the e3 square for the Bishop on g5 
by playing f3.}
7...Qa5 {The Queen is out as it anticipates White to play O-O-O. 7...O-O is risky as 8.h4 followed by h5 and a possible Nd5 to 
pressurise the Knight on f6 are on the cards. White is quite smart with his moves so far.}
8.Bc4 {An excellent square for the Bishop that puts pressure on the f7 pawn}
8...Rb8  {Black wants to expand on the Queenside with ...b5 anticipating O-O-O from White}
9.O-O-O {9.Bb3 was better}
9...b5 {As planned Black is the first one with the Queenside offensive and White now has to play some reactive chess instead of 
being proactive}
10.Bb3 b4{Black presses further}
11.Nd5 Nxd5 {Trading pieces helps Black here}
