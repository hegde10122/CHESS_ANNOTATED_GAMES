[Opening "Italian Game, Giuoco Piano"]
[Variation "Pianissimo"]

1.e4 e5 {Both sides push their King pawns to optimal squares and control the central squares - a key motif of opening chess}
2.Nf3 {Attacking the e5 pawn by developing the Knight.}
2...Nc6 {Developing the Knight anf protecting the central e5 pawn}
3.Bc4 {Eyeing the f7 pawn and looking for a possible Ng5 combination in the future}
3...Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano or the Italian opening. 
Here Black stops White from playing 4.Ng5 or else Black will have to set himself up for some attacking chess.}
4.c3 {White prepares the d4 pawn push. This will help White to occupy the centre with two central pawns by harassing the Bishop on c5}
4...Nf6 {Black does not worry about 5.d4 as 5...exd4 6.cxd4 Bb4+ 7.Bd2 Nxe4 8.Bxb4 Nxb4 9.Bxf7+ Kxf7 10.Qb3+ Kf8 11.Qxb4+ equalises easily.
The move 7.Bd2 allowing 7...Nxe4 is harmless,in my opinion,if White finds the moves correctly}
5.d3 {White defends the pawn on e4.This leads to the Pianissimo variation}
5...a5 {Here the a7 square is vacated for the Bishop on c5. This is due to the fact that White retains the possibility of playing d4 
or even b4 at some point soon. The Bishop would be harassed and it is important for Black to keep his Bishop on the a7-g1 diagonal for 
strategic purposes as it eyes the f2 pawn. The move ...a5 is prophylactic in nature as it also prevents his plans of pushing b4,a4 and b5 or 
a5 to expand on the Queenside.White needs to find out some other plan to win the battle.}
6.O-O {Best continuation according to me for White}
6...d6 {6...O-O?! is not a good choice as 7.d4!? Bb6 8.dxe5 allows White to win a pawn. The move played adds more protection to the e5 
pawn and renders 7.d4 with no great advantage for White.}
7.Re1 {White develops the Rook because the Black King is still in the centre.}
7...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and preventing 8.d4. 7...O-O is also acceptable.1-0. Black loses on time}

3.d5 {White keeps the centre closed and expands.}
3...d6 {Black wants to have ...e5 soon to challenge White's expansion in the centre.The Bishop on f4 is also blunted to some extent.}
4.Nc3 {White does not play the usually seen c4 is Queen pawn opening setups. White wants to control the e4 square with the pawn next}
4...g6 {4...Qb6 5.e4!? Qxb2 6.Bd2 Qb6 and Black has wasted precious tempi to grab a pawn. 7.Rb1 Qd8 8.f4 and White will have great activity 
for the lost pawn.}
5.e4 {White carries out his plan and has an expanded centre. White should now look for active play on the Queenside as the central 
pawn complex and the dark-squared Bishop on f4 are eyeing on that side.}
5...Bg7 {Black continues to develop the Kingside pieces and will be content playing a closed pawn-structure game}
6.Nf3 {White too wants to develop the Kingside and follow suit}
6...O-O {Black is the first to finish casting and is ready for a struggle on the central squares with the Bishop on g7 as a primary player}
7.Be2 {7.Bd3 also looks okay. But Black has the potential ...a6,...b5 and ...c4 onslaught at his disposal that will drive the Bishop 
on d3 backwards.}
7...Nh5?! {This looks questionable in my opinion. Black puts his Knight as the aggressor attacking the London Bishop on f4.
7...a6 looks a better alternative preparing ...b5}
8.Bg5 {A provocative move asking Black whether he would risk damaging his pawn structure. The Bishop on g5 wants to ruffle feathers and 
nothing menacing}
8...f6 {Black kicks the Bishop away bit creates a weak e6 square}
9.Be3 {With the possibilities of Qd2 open White retreats to a safer square}
9...Bg4?! {Black develops yet another piece and probably would exchange the Knight on f3.But was that a good move. In my opinion 
Black should have challenged White's central pawn complex with 9...f5 which would have vacated the f6 square for the Knight on h5 }
10.h3 {Black will have to take the Knight or else its activity would be minimal on the c8-g4 diagonal}
10...Bxf3 11.Bxf3 Qe8?? {The Knight on h5 is trapped. 11...f5 was the way to go}

[Opening "Ruy Lopez Closed"]
[Variation "Chigorin Defense"]

1.e4 {The most popular King pawn opening for White in classical chess.Here White opens up the f1-b5 diagonal for his 
light-squared Bishop on f1 and plans to develop the Knight on g1 to f3 followed by O-O to complete rapid development.
White also controls the d5 and f5 squares - a strategic idea in the opening.}
1...e5 {Black copies White's idea and looks to have an equal say in the central squares by controlling the d4 and f4 squares. This move 
also disallows White from playing 2.d4 that would allow White to put the two central pawns on ideal squares giving him a great 
space advantage.}
2.Nf3 {A solid move where White attacks the e5 pawn and wants Black to react to the immediate threat of 3.Nxe5 on the next move. 
It also controls the d4 square - an important strategic goal in the opening for White.}
2...Nc6 {Protecting the pawn and developing a piece. It is equally important for Black to follow the opening principles in chess - 
rapid development of pieces on optimal squares, centre control by pawns or pieces and castling the King.}
3.Bb5 {Another good move which leads to the Ruy Lopez opening or the Spanish opening. Here White has developed his Kingside pieces and 
is ready to play O-O next. The main idea is to put pressure on Black's Knight that protects the e5 pawn. White is renewing the 
threat of Nxe5 as well.The Ruy Lopez opening was created in the 16th century, and was named after Spanish priest Ruy Lopez de Segura.
White and Black will now fight to control the central squares by placing two pawns here - the main goal of the Ruy lopez opening.}
3...a6 {Black kicks the Bishop and asks him the obvious question - Do you want to exchange the Bishop for my Knight on c6 by playing
4.Bxc6? This move if played, damages the Black pawn structure but is not considered to be a great option for White because not only does 
he lose the Bishop pair but also wastes time by exchanging a good piece thereby losing a great protector of his own light squares.}
4.Ba4 {White maintains the pressure on the Knight on c6 by retreating to a safer square.}
4...Nf6 {Black counterattacks in the centre with the threat of 5...Nxe4. This is similar to White strategy of Nxe5.}
5.O-O {White need not worry about the pawn on e4. If 5...Nxe4 then 6.d4 is good for White. 
For example to continue further, 6...b5 7.Bb3 d5
8.dxe5 which allows White to regain the pawn. Black is behind in development and losing the initiative.
In this sequence if Black decides to retreat the Knight on e4 by playing 7...Nf6?? then White wins after 8.Nxe5 threatening the pawn on 
f7.
5.d3 is also playable but defeats the purpose of the main goal of this opening.
5.Nc3 blocks the c-pawn and prevents the plan of occupying the centre with c3 and d4.
5.Qe2 develops the queen and protects the pawn on e4. But this move would be against the general opening principles. A possible ...Nd4 
in the future would harass the White Queen on e2.
5.d4 would jeopardize White's play so far and would be in contradiction of his Bishop development on b5. This Bishop is now on a4 
serving a strategic purpose and 5.d4 would allow 5...exd4 which has reduced Black's headache on controlling the pawn on e5.
By castling the King White has attained another objective of the openings in chess - Protecting the King and also developing the Rook 
to the central file where it can assist to control the central squares.
}
5...Be7 {The closed system of the Spanish opening begins after this move. 5...Nxe4 leads to the open Sicilian system. This Knight 
capturing the pawn is also a good move but Black does not retain the advantage of the extra pawn without sacrificing development. 
By developing the Bishop on e7 Black has closed the e-file and renews the threat of 6...Nxe4.}
6.Re1 {Not only does White develop the Rook, but also protects the pawn on e4. White now has ideas of playing c3 and d4 which will allow
him to carry out the main goal of the Ruy Lopez - putting two central pawns on optimal squares. All the possible ways of protecting 
the e4 pawn on the earlier move are possible here but the Rook on e1 is considered best as White would retain a slight advantage 
after putting the pawns on c3 and d4 which would keep the pressure intact in the centre. Black's counterattack is thus nullified.}
6...b5 {Black eliminates the threat of 7.Bxc6 followed by 8.Nxe5 and expands on the Queenside.}
7.Bb3 {The Bishop nows eyes the pawn on f7 but remember that White played the Bishop moves thrice in the opening to carry out 
his strategy. This is not inferior at all. Black can now focus on developing his pieces and castle.}
7...d6 {Black overprotects the e5 pawn and opens up the c8-g4 diagonal for the light-squared Bishop on c8.Black also opens up 
the possibility of ...Na5 on the next move to capture the Bishop on b3 - a nuisance for Black. Black has thus opened up two good 
possibilities for development and exchange of material to neutralize White's initiative.}
8.c3 {Black vacates the c2 square for the Bishop if Black plays 8...Na5. Also prepares for the d4 pawn push to complete the Spanish setup}
8...O-O {Black completes development of the Kingside}
9.h3 {White does not want Black to play 9...Bg4 which allows sufficient activity after the Knight on f3 is pinned.}
9...Na5 {Black wants the Bishop on b3 to retreat and go back to c2 where its efficacy is blunted by its own pawn on e4 - a slight 
strategical punch}
10.Bc2 {White wants to keep the Bishop pair and both the Bishops want to participate in a Kingside offensive in the future.}
10...c5 {To add more pressure on the d4 square}
11.d4 {White finally attains his objective of putting two pawns in the centre}
11...Qc7 {Black wants to keep his e5 pawn intact and adds another defender because the knight on c6 is now on a5}
12.Nbd2 {White now wants to develop his Queenside and starts with the Knight. In the long term, White would love to take this Knight 
on d2 to f5 via the d2-f1-g3-f5 route where he can press for a Kingside attack.}
12...Bd7 {Connecting the Rooks as 12...Bd7 allows White the possibilities of pushing d5 and curtailing the light-squared Bishop's activity.
Black's Knight on a5 is also a problem now as it needs to be brought back to action.}
13.Nf1 {White wants to plant the Knight on d5 via the f1-e3-d5 route which will allow him a great position.}
13...Nc4!? {The Knight covers the e3 square and can now come back to b6. Black can also aim to expand further on the Queenside 
in the future with ...a5 and ...a4. This Knight move has vacated the a5 square for the pawn on a7.}
14.Ng3 {White wants to play Nf5 next}
14...Rfc8 {This move indirectly attacks the Bishop on c2. White has no time for 15.Nf5? cxd4! 16.cxd4 Nxb2! 17.Bxb2 Qxc2 with a great
position}
15.d5 {Cutting out the option ...cxd4 and gaining space in the centre}
15...Nb6 {The Knight retreats as the pawn structure is closed}
16.Be3 {White does not play 16.Nf5 as 16...Bxf5 17.exf5 destroys White pawn structure in the centre. After having pushed d5 
White wants to enjoy space advantage. The move played is flexible and wants Black to jump the gun}
16...g6* {No more Nf5 ideas.White  now needs to change the plan as Black awaits.}

1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 {The Vienna Game}
2...Nf6 3.g3 {White wants to play solid chess and does not opt for the aggressive looking 3.Bc4}
3...d5 {Here Black grabs the opportunity to grab the centre without too many complexities}
4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bd6 {Black is good to go as White has eased tensions}
7.Nf3 Nc6 {7...Bg4 allows White to X-ray the pawn on b7. Rb1 would put additional pressure on Black. The Knight on c6 blunts the 
Bishop on c6 to a certain extent}
8.O-O {White continues to develop without any aggression and wants to stifle Black in the long run}
8...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and forcing White to weaken the pawn structure with a possible h3 on the next move}
9.d3 {Preventing ...e4}
9...O-O
10.h3 Bh5 {Black keeps up the pressure on the pinned Knight}
