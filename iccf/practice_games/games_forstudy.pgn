1.d4 d5 
2.Bf4 {The London system}
2...e6 {Black solidifies the centre but locks in the Bishop on c8}
3.e3 f5?! {In my opinion, this is not a good continuation as Black has weakened the Kingside.This is the Sarratt attack.Black is 
probably trying to set up a Dutch stonewall by playing c6,Be7,Nf6 and O-O. Black has clamped down on the e4 square after 3...f5}
4.c4 {Here White attacks the pawn chain and is ready to exchange cxd4 soon. White does not play Nf3 }
4...Nf6 5.Nc3 c6 {As guessed - the Dutch stonewall is coming up where the e5 square is a possible "hole" for Black and White 
needs to capitalise on that}
6.Bd3 {White does not play 6.Nf3 and keeps an eye on the h5 square to avert 6...Nh5}
6...Be7 {Black does not play ...Bd6 because it is only piece with authority to control the dark squares}
7.h3 {Vacating the h2 square for the Bishop on f4. Also taking away the g4 square from the Knight. In this Dutch setup, 
Black usually plays ...Qe8,followed by ...Qg6,...g5 and ...h5.So it is a preparatory move for the possible Black rampage on the Kingside }
7...O-O 8.Nf3 {Both sides develop their pieces}
8...Ne4 {The thematic Dutch move where Black occupies the e4 square with the Knight. Black's plan include...Nd7,Ndf6,g5,h5,Qe8,Qg6...
attack,attack and attack!!}
9.Rc1 {White wants to keeps things under wraps and does not castle.White can also play cxd5 soon and possibly exert some pressure along the 
c-file. Another important thing --- Black can also play 9...Nxc3 to simplify the position. 10.Rxc3 is a favourable way to capture the 
Knight back}
9...Nd7 {This Knight might appear on f6 for a Kingside offensive.}
10.Qc2 {Another move that adds more influence to the e4 square}
10...a5 {Black plays on the Queenside flank}
11.O-O {As Black does not seem committal towards a Kingside offensive, it is perhaps the right time to castle}
11...Qe8 {Black was waiting for White to castle and now takes a baby step towards the King on g1}
12.Nd2 {Since Black will now play on the Kingside, the Black Knight on e4 will play an important role. White wants to play f3 next and derail 
Black's plan.}
12...g5 {As expected,The Dutch attack has begun}
13.Bh2 {The importance of move 7 is now visible}
13...Qh5 {The Black Queen is out to checkmate the White King}
14.Ndxe4 {The point of move 12. The Knight on e4 must go}
14...fxe4 {Opening up the -file}
15.Be2 {The Bishop hits back at the Queen}
15...Qe8 16.f3! {The decisive pawn-break. White keeps asking questions and does not allow Black to coordinate his pieces}
16...exf3 17.Rxf3 {Asking for a Rook trade as well}
17...Rxf3 18.Bxf3 {Black's attack has been curbed decisively and he is left with undeveloped pieces}
18...Nf6 19.Rf1 {Both parties bring pieces to the Kingside as Black try to revive his failed bid earlier}
19...Bd7 {The 'pawn' Bishop is ready!!}
20.Be5 {Bringing another piece to a central square}
20...dxc4 {Black offers a draw here!!}
21.Ne4 {Attacking the g5 pawn and forcing Black to make another trade decision as far as the Knight on f6 is concerned}
21...Nxe4 22.Bxe4 {23.Bxh7# is on the cards}
22...Qh5 {Protecting the h7 pawn}
23.Bxh7+ {White goes for simplification and a superior end game. 23...Qxh7 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rf7+ is on the cards. Black resigned}
