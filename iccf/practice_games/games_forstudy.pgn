[Opening "Vienna Game"]
[Variation "Mieses Variation"]
1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 {The Vienna Game}
2...Nf6 3.g3 {White wants to play solid chess and does not opt for the aggressive looking 3.Bc4}
3...d5 {Here Black grabs the opportunity to grab the centre without too many complexities}
4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bd6 {Black is good to go as White has eased tensions}
7.Nf3 Nc6 {7...Bg4 allows White to X-ray the pawn on b7. Rb1 would put additional pressure on Black. The Knight on c6 blunts the 
Bishop on c6 to a certain extent}
8.O-O {White continues to develop without any aggression and wants to stifle Black in the long run}
8...Bg4 {Pinning the Knight and forcing White to weaken the pawn structure with a possible h3 on the next move}
9.d3 {Preventing ...e4}
9...O-O
10.h3 Bh5 {Black keeps up the pressure on the pinned Knight}
11.Rb1 {Looking to grab the b7 pawn}
11...Rb8 {Protecting the pawn}
12.c4 {Not sure why White pushed the pawn.A better alternative was to remove the pin. 12.g4 Bg6 13.Be3 or 13.Re1 
with an equal position}
12...f5 {Preventing 13.g4 and also adding more power to the e4 square.}
13.Qd2 {Unpinning the Knight and looking to play Qg5. The Bishop on h5 needs to find a better place for a newer impact}
13...h6 {Cutting out the Qg5 option for White}
14.Bb2 {Adding another attacker to the e5 pawn. Now Rfe1 on the next move will begin the battle for the e5 pawn}
14...Qf6 {Now why such a move that X-rays your own Queen against the Bishop on b2 - you might ask? 
This move is actually quite harmless as 15.Rfe1 Rfe8 which begins the skirmish for the e5 pawn. 16.d4 e4! 17.d5! 
and the Black Queen is attacked 17...Ne5! 18.Nxe5 Bxe5 19.Bxe5 Qxe5 and Black is quite okay here}
15.Rfe1 {As expected}
15...Bb4 {Black plays another move that is curtailing White's efforts at executing his plan for the e5 pawn. Attacking the Queen 
and if the Queen moves then the Rook falls}
16.c3? {Fixes the pawn structure and kills the activity of the Bishop on b2.16.Bc3 Bxc3 17.Qxc3 Bxf3 18.Qxf3 was the way to go}
16...Bd6 {White's pawn structure is not only compromised but the attack on the e5 pawn has been smothered}
17.Nh4 {Looking to cool off the steam after 18.Nxf5 Qxf5 19.g4 Bxg4 20.hxg4 Qxg4}
17...f4! {The possibility of capturing the f5 pawn is stalled. Now Black is taking initiative on the Kingside. }
18.Be4 {Looking to impose the Knight on f5}
18...Ne7 {Again prophylaxis. The move  19.Nf5 is stalled}
19.Kg2 {Adding more protection to the g3 pawn}
19...b6 {White does not want to tie the Rook on b8 to watch the b7 pawn. The Rook can be activated on the nice semi-open d-file to X-ray the 
White Queen. 19...Ng6 20.Bxg6 Bxg6 21.Nxg6 Qxg6 22.g4 blocks the g-file. Now 22...h5 23.f3 and Black has to work hard for the meal}
20.d4 {Challenging the centre is not a great idea as Rd8 is coming that will force the White Queen to react
20.Rf1 looks better as White needs to beef up his defense on the f-file. fxg3 looms large}
20...Rbd8 {Occupying the semi-open d-file as Black's latent piece is now active and ready to go}
21.Qc2?? {A blunder that leads to immediate exchange of pawns and opening up the floodgates}
21...exd4 
22.cxd4 fxg3 {The Knight on h4 has no support now. So 23.d5 will not work as 23...Qxh4 is available}
23.fxg3 Bxg3 {Again eliminating the defender of the Knight. The White King is now on open ground}
24.Kxg3 Qf4+ 25.Kg2 Qxh4 {Black is a pawn up with the White King exposed}
26.Rf1 {Trying to blunt the f-file influence}
26...Ng6 {The plan is to play Nf4 followed by Qxh3+.}
27.Kh2 {Now 28.Bxg6 is the idea}
27...Nf4 {Attacking the h3 pawn}
28.Bg2? {28.Qb3 was perhaps the best alternative. This move leaves the g6-b1 diagonal bare open for the Bishop on h5 to attack the Queen}
28...Bg6 {Attacking the Queen and the Rook on b1 will fall after the Queen moves}
29.Qf2 Qxf2 30.Rxf2 Bxb1 {Winning the Rook and White is lost here. White resigned. 0-1}

[Opening "Indian Defense"]
[Variation "London System"]

1.d4 Nf6 {The Indian defense where Black develops a piece instead of a pawn to control the central d5 and e4 squares}
2.Bf4 {The London system}
2...d5 {Black strengthens his hold over the e4 square}
3.e3 c5 {Asking the question directly to the central pawn - ? Do you want an exchange?}
4.c3 {Adding more resource to control the d4 square thereby creating a pyramid}
4...Nc6 {Black will most likely play ...Qb6 and attack the b2 pawn}
5.Nf3?! {5.Nd2 was better.}
5...Qb6 {Black increases the pressure over the d4 pawn and also wants to gobble up the b2 pawn}
6.Qb3 c4 {Expanding the Queenside and asking White to go for a Queen exchange that would allow Black to have the open a-file }
7.Qc2 Bf5 {Offering a piece that will allow Black to win material after ...Qxb2 followed by ...Qxa1}
8.Qc1 {The only good move that protects the b2 pawn}
8...e6 {Black is doing really well as the last piece on f8 can now come out on e7}
9.Nbd2 Be7 {Black is in complete control of the e4 square}
10.b3 {White attacks the head of the pawn chain on c4. He wants to play bxc4 to win a pawn after ...dxc4 followed by Bxc4.
White cannot afford to play a timid move like 10.Be2 followed by O-O. Black's light-squared pawn complex with the head on c4 is a 
dangerous looking proposition.}
10...Qa5 {Black wants to play 11...Ba3 12.Qd1 Qxc3 with a great position}
11.a4 {...Ba3 is prevented as of now}
11...cxb3 12.Nxb3 12...Qb6 {Attacking the Knight} 13.Qb2 {It is passive for White at the moment}
13...Nh5 14.a5 {Looking to kick away the Queen and remove the bind for the Queen on b2}
14...Qd8 15.Be5 f6 16.Bg3 Nxg3 17.hxg3 Qc7 {Another Queen move. 17...O-O much better}
18.Be2 e5? {18...O-O was the way to go. This leaves the Bishop on f5 without any support}
19.Nh4 {Taking advantage of the fact that the Bishop cannot go back to g6 as 19...Bg6?? 20.Nxg6 hxg6 21.Rxh8+ winning the Rook}
19...Qd7 {The g6 square control cannot be given up because of 20.Ng6 taking advantage of the pinned pawn on h7.20...Rg8 21.Rxh7 wins a pawn
after 19...Be6}
20.Nxf5 Qxf5 21.Nc5 {Attacking the weak b7 pawn twice. The Bishop on e7 is a mute spectator and can simplify things if the 
Knight is traded}
21...Bxc5 22.Qxb7 Qc8 {The Queen comes back to guard all attacked pieces}
22.Bh5+ g6 23.Bxg6+ hxg6 24.Rxh8+ Bf8 25.Qg7 {Black resigned}

1.d4 Nf6 
2.Bf4 {The London system}
2...d5 {Black grabs the centre instead of resorting to Indian defense systems by pushing the pawn to d5}
3.e3 c5 {Black attacks the central pawn structure}
4.c3 {The triangle formation in the London system}
4...Nc6 {Black is planning ...Qb6 to attack the b2 pawn.}
5.Nd2 {Anticipating 5...Qb6 The b1 and c1 squares are vacated for the Rook. This move is better than 5.Nf3 because 
5...Qb6 6.Qb3 c4 7.Qc2 Bf5! 8.Qc1 rendering the White Queen to an ineffective place. Now the White pieces on the Queenside are 
not in sync anymore due to Black's aggression. So 5.Nd2 is better to as 7...Bf5 is not good with the above continuation}
5...Bf5 {Taking away the c2 square from the White Queen.}
6.Ngf3 Qb6 {Attacking the weak b2 pawn}
7.dxc5 {White gives up the central pawn here. This is a new try as compared to 7.Qb3 c4 8.Qxb6 axb6 9.Be2 e6 10.O-O}
7...Qxb2 {Black grabs the b2 pawn and is now ready for Qxc3}
8.Nd4 {Attacking the Bishop on f5. 
Option 1: 8.Rc1 Qxa2 9.Bb5 pinning the Knight. 9...g6 10.Ne5 Rc8 and the game continues with Black a pawn up
Option 2: 8.Qc1 Qxc1+ 9.Rxc1 Qd7
Option 3: 8.Be2 Qxc3 is not a good alternative to the move played.}
8...Bg4 {Attacking the Queen while keeping the ...Qxc3 option open}
9.f3 {Option 1: 9. Be2 e5! 10.Bxg4 exf4 11.O-O Bxc5 with Qxc3 soon. Black is better
Option 2: 9.Qc1 Qxc1+ 10.Rxc1 e5! 11.Nxc6 exf4 12.Ne5 fxe3 with advantage to Black
Option 3: 9.Rb1?! Qxc3 10.Nb5 Qa5 and the White Queen is still attacked while Black has gobbled up the c3 pawn. This is again good for Black
}
9...e5  {Forking the minor pieces and again keeping the threat of ...Qxc3 alive on the next move.Black is also ready for ...Bxc5 }
10.Nb5 {Black had created three threats - fork on e5, ...Bxc5 and ...Qxc3. The move played cuts out all the escape squares for the 
Black Queen. This move amplifies the fact that the idea of dxc5 on move 7 was not a good one. White can at best hope to make a draw by playing Rb1 
next and forcing the Black Queen to dance around without an escape}
10...O-O-O
11.Rb1 Qxa2 12.Ra1 Qb2 13.Rb1 Qa2 14.Ra1 Qb2 15.Rb1 Qa2 {Draw.Three fold repetition.White's 7th move was ineffective. 7.Qb3 was better}

[BlackTeam "Netherlands"]

1.d4 d5 
2.Bf4 {The London system}
2...e6 {Black solidifies the centre but locks in the Bishop on c8}
3.e3 f5?! {In my opinion, this is not a good continuation as Black has weakened the Kingside.This is the Sarratt attack.Black is 
probably trying to set up a Dutch stonewall by playing c6,Be7,Nf6 and O-O. Black has clamped down on the e4 square after 3...f5}
4.c4 {Here White attacks the pawn chain and is ready to exchange cxd4 soon. White does not play Nf3 }
4...Nf6 5.Nc3 c6 {As guessed - the Dutch stonewall is coming up where the e5 square is a possible "hole" for Black and White 
needs to capitalise on that}
6.Bd3 {White does not play 6.Nf3 and keeps an eye on the h5 square to avert 6...Nh5}
6...Be7 {Black does not play ...Bd6 because it is only piece with authority to control the dark squares}
7.h3 {Vacating the h2 square for the Bishop on f4. Also taking away the g4 square from the Knight. In this Dutch setup, 
Black usually plays ...Qe8,followed by ...Qg6,...g5 and ...h5.So it is a preparatory move for the possible Black rampage on the Kingside }
7...O-O 8.Nf3 {Both sides develop their pieces}
8...Ne4 {The thematic Dutch move where Black occupies the e4 square with the Knight. Black's plan include...Nd7,Ndf6,g5,h5,Qe8,Qg6...
attack,attack and attack!!}
9.Rc1 {White wants to keeps things under wraps and does not castle.White can also play cxd5 soon and possibly exert some pressure along the 
c-file. Another important thing --- Black can also play 9...Nxc3 to simplify the position. 10.Rxc3 is a favourable way to capture the 
Knight back}
9...Nd7 {This Knight might appear on f6 for a Kingside offensive.}
10.Qc2 {Another move that adds more influence to the e4 square}
10...a5 {Black plays on the Queenside flank}
11.O-O {As Black does not seem committal towards a Kingside offensive, it is perhaps the right time to castle}
11...Qe8 {Black was waiting for White to castle and now takes a baby step towards the King on g1}
12.Nd2 {Since Black will now play on the Kingside, the Black Knight on e4 will play an important role. White wants to play f3 next and derail 
Black's plan.}
12...g5 {As expected,The Dutch attack has begun}
13.Bh2 {The importance of move 7 is now visible}
13...Qh5 {The Black Queen is out to checkmate the White King}
14.Ndxe4 {The point of move 12. The Knight on e4 must go}
14...fxe4 {Opening up the -file}
15.Be2 {The Bishop hits back at the Queen}
15...Qe8 16.f3! {The decisive pawn-break. White keeps asking questions and does not allow Black to coordinate his pieces}
16...exf3 17.Rxf3 {Asking for a Rook trade as well}
17...Rxf3 18.Bxf3 {Black's attack has been curbed decisively and he is left with undeveloped pieces}
18...Nf6 19.Rf1 {Both parties bring pieces to the Kingside as Black try to revive his failed bid earlier}
19...Bd7 {The 'pawn' Bishop is ready!!}
20.Be5 {Bringing another piece to a central square}
20...dxc4 {Black offers a draw here!!}
21.Ne4 {Attacking the g5 pawn and forcing Black to make another trade decision as far as the Knight on f6 is concerned}
21...Nxe4 22.Bxe4 {23.Bxh7# is on the cards}
22...Qh5 {Protecting the h7 pawn}
23.Bxh7+ {White goes for simplification and a superior end game. 23...Qxh7 24.Qxh7+ Kxh7 25.Rf7+ is on the cards. Black resigned}
