1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...d5 {Identical opening move controlling the e4 and c4 squares}
2.c4 {The best response in accordance with theory}
2...e6 {2...c6 leads to the Slav defence.The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is now on the board.}
3.Nc3 {White is ready to play 4.cxd5 next if Black plays 3...Nf6 leading to the exchange variation of the Queen's gambit declined}
3...c6 {The Semi-Slav is on the board where Black overprotects the d5 pawn. His main idea is to play ...dxc4 at some point followed by ...b5,...Bb7.}
4.e3 {The c4 pawn is now protected as White prepares to swing his light-squared Bishop to d3 or play the quiet Be2 soon.}
4...Nf6 {Black develops the Knight}
5.Nf3 {White's common response as developing the Bishop on f1 allows Black to play ...dxc4 and attain one of his objectives in the semi-Slav.}
5...Nbd7 {Black is ready to play the complicated lines in the Meran system}
6.Qc2{The Queen controls the e4 square and White does not commit the Bishop on f1 to d3 or e2.}
6...Bd6 {Black is ready to castle and is also ready to push ...e5}
7.cxd5 {7.b3 is an Anti-Meran move where Black's ...dxc4 is no longer a great idea as White can capture back with bxc4.
7.Bd3 has also been played widely and is a known theoretical line
where White does not gain anything significant. The move played deviates from theory and Black will have to adopt new plans to gain an advantage.}
7...exd5 {Black captures away from the centre and prepares to play ...Re8 after castling short. White will not have the move Ne5 as the e-file has been opened up.}
8.Bd3 {White has cleared matters in the centre and prepares to push e4 at some point in the near future and prepares to castle Kingside}
8...O-O {Black is good as is the case in the Semi-Slav.}
9.O-O {White will now play Re1 and then look to push e4 and gain space in the centre.}
9...Re8 {As planned.Black does not allow an easy e4 for White}
10.Re1 {Preparing e4}
10...Nf8 {...Bg4 is prepared and Black is ready to play ...Bxf3 to damage White's pawn structure}
11.h3 {The g4 square is taken away for the moment from Black's pieces}
11...Be6 {The Bishop develops to the best possible square available}
12.a4 {The Queen side expansion begins}
12...Ng6 {Black is solid here. 12...a5 is also a good choice}
13.Ng5 {Attacking the h7 pawn for the third time}
13...Nf8 {The Knight on g6 adds further protection to the pawn on h7}
14.f4 {14.Nxe6 is playable but White's Bishop on c1 is a problematic piece and White's Bishop pair is pseudo influential at best.
Instead White's plan is to play Qf2,Nf3 followed by Ne5 where the Knight on e5 will be a solid piece. The move played is planned to
create a stronghold on the e5 square and Black must react accordingly.
14.b3 is also a good plan where White intends to play Qa2 followed by Ba3 to exchange the bad Bishop with its counterpart on d6.}
14...Rc8*

1.e4 {The King pawn opening considered to be the oldest opening move by many}
1...g6 {Black goes for the complicated and swashbuckling Modern defence.}
2.d4 {When presented with an opportunity grab the centre with both hands. White's most common response in the Modern.}
2...Bg7 {The matador Bishop will attack on the a1-h8 diagonal. Black's plans include playing ...d6 followed by ...e5 or ...c5 to stake a claim in the centre.}
3.Nf3 {The classical line where White is contend to develop pieces. 3.f4 allows White to go for the brutal Austrian attack}
3...d6 {Preventing e5 and preparing ...Nf6}
4.Bd3 {A quiet move where White will probably castle next. 4.h3!? is also possible where White takes away the g4 square for the Black Bishop on c8.}
4...Nf6 {Transposing into the Pirc defense.}
5.O-O {White could have still played 5.h3!? or even 5.c4}
5...Nbd7 {A slow line where Black prepares the ...e5 thrust in the centre forcing White to make a decision. This move on the other hand blocks the Queen's vigil of the
d-file allowing White to push e5 himself.}
6.e5 {White grabs the opportunity to expand in the centre and gains space.}
6...dxe5 {Forced as the Knight was attacked}
7.dxe5 {Reinforcement in equal measure}
7...Nd5 {7...Ng4 also looks okay with a triple attack on the e5 pawn. 8.e6! forcing Black to have a dubious pawn structure.
8...fxe6 9.Qe2 attacking the pawn on e6.Now Black cannot O-O as Qxe6 comes with check, 9...c6. This move vacates the c7 square for the Queen.10.Rd1 Qc7 and the position is playable for Black}
8.Re1 {Protecting the wedge pawn on e5 and threatening Bxg6 followed by Qxd5 winning back the piece.}
8...c6 {A necessary move to prevent 9.Bxg6. The Knight on d5 gets added protection}
9.Bc4 {Attacking the Knight again and White threatens to win a pawn after Bxd5 on the next move.Again Black is forced to defend the Knight and go for a delayed castling.}
9...Nc5 {The Queen protects the Knight on d5 as the Knight on d7 vacates the e6 square for the Bishop on c8 to join the party}
10.Qd4 {The Queen is ready to swing to h4. Now the Black Knight has to move back again}
10...Ne6 {Attacking the Queen}
11.Qh4 {The Queen comes to h4 as planned and White is ready for Bh6 and exchange the Bishops weakening the dark squares in the Black camp}
11...h6 {The g5 square is taken out for the moment as Black cannot castle short any time soon}
12.Nc3 {White develops the Knight but he is willing to damage his pawn structure in the process.12.Bd2 looks more solid in my opinion.}
12...Nxc3 {12...Nb6 does not look a prudent choice.13.Bb3 Nc5 14.Be3 and has a tremendous lead in development with a clear edge. 12...g5 is also
a poor choice as 13.Qh5 allows White to lord the light-squared weaknesses on the Kingside.The Black King will then remain precariously
placed in the centre of the board for a while. 13...b5 14.Bb3 and White is nicely placed here.}
13.bxc3 Qa5 {The Queen attacks the c3 pawn as a countermeasure as Black's pieces are still tied up}
14.Qe4 {For some strange reason,White centralises the Queen again.14.Bd2 or 14.Rb1 look better.Perhaps White was banking on 14...Qxc3?
15.Bd1! Qa3 16.Nh4 O-O 17.Nxg6 and Black's position falls apart}
14...Nc5* {Attacking the Queen with tempo. This move also vacates the e6 square for the Bishop on c8.}
