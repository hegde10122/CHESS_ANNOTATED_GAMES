1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}
1...d5 {Identical opening move controlling the e4 and c4 squares}
2.c4 {The best response in accordance with theory}
2...e6 {2...c6 leads to the Slav defence.The Queen's Gambit Declined or QGD is now on the board.}
3.Nc3 {White is ready to play 4.cxd5 next if Black plays 3...Nf6 leading to the exchange variation of the Queen's gambit declined}
3...c6 {The Semi-Slav is on the board where Black overprotects the d5 pawn. His main idea is to play ...dxc4 at some point followed by ...b5,...Bb7.}
4.e3 {The c4 pawn is now protected as White prepares to swing his light-squared Bishop to d3 or play the quiet Be2 soon.}
4...Nf6 {Black develops the Knight}
5.Nf3 {White's common response as developing the Bishop on f1 allows Black to play ...dxc4 and attain one of his objectives in the semi-Slav.}
5...Nbd7 {Black is ready to play the complicated lines in the Meran system}
6.Qc2{The Queen controls the e4 square and White does not commit the Bishop on f1 to d3 or e2.}
6...Bd6 {Black is ready to castle and is also ready to push ...e5}
7.cxd5 {7.b3 is an Anti-Meran move where Black's ...dxc4 is no longer a great idea as White can capture back with bxc4.
7.Bd3 has also been played widely and is a known theoretical line
where White does not gain anything significant. The move played deviates from theory and Black will have to adopt new plans to gain an advantage.}
7...exd5 {Black captures away from the centre and prepares to play ...Re8 after castling short. White will not have the move Ne5 as the e-file has been opened up.}
8.Bd3 {White has cleared matters in the centre and prepares to push e4 at some point in the near future and prepares to castle Kingside}
8...O-O {Black is good as is the case in the Semi-Slav.}
9.O-O {White will now play Re1 and then look to push e4 and gain space in the centre.}
9...Re8 {As planned.Black does not allow an easy e4 for White}
10.Re1 {Preparing e4}
10...Nf8 {...Bg4 is prepared and Black is ready to play ...Bxf3 to damage White's pawn structure}
11.h3 {The g4 square is taken away for the moment from Black's pieces}
11...Be6 {The Bishop develops to the best possible square available}
12.a4 {The Queen side expansion begins}
12...Ng6 {Black is solid here. 12...a5 is also a good choice}
13.Ng5 {Attacking the h7 pawn for the third time}
13...Nf8 {The Knight on g6 adds further protection to the pawn on h7}
14.f4 {14.Nxe6 is playable but White's Bishop on c1 is a problematic piece and White's Bishop pair is pseudo influential at best.
Instead White's plan is to play Qf2,Nf3 followed by Ne5 where the Knight on e5 will be a solid piece. The move played is planned to
create a stronghold on the e5 square and Black must react accordingly.
14.b3 is also a good plan where White intends to play Qa2 followed by Ba3 to exchange the bad Bishop with its counterpart on d6.}
14...Rc8 {Preparing ...c5 although 14...c5 was also playable}
15.Qf2 {Transferring the Queen to the Kingside}
15...Bb4 {The pawn structure looks fixed and Black wants to remove the Knight as the Bishop's prospects are not great}
16.Bd2 {White's Bishop on d2 is also not looking great either}
16...c5 {The thematic move in the Semi-Slav where Black gets his stake in the centre}
17.Bc2 {In view of ...c4 on the next move that will allow Black to grab more space on the Queenside}
17...Bd7 {The Bishop will }
18.Nf3 {Preparing Ne5}
18...cxd4 {Opening up the c-file and breaking White's pawn structure in the process. White will not be able to push e4 now}
19.exd4 {19.Nxd4 allows 19...Ne6 and any exchanges favour Black as White's Kingside initiative loses steam.}
19...Bxc3 {Another trade and Black wants to eliminate the Knight which has an important role to play in the closed pawn setup.}
20.Bxc3 Ne4 {Black places the Knight on a nice central square}
21.Bxe4 {Eliminating the Knight which exerted too much influence in the centre}
21...dxe4 {Black is happy to trade with the pawn.21...Rxe4 22.Rxe4 will allow White to liquidate further.}
22.Nd2 {The Knight goes back and attacks the e4 pawn}
22...Bc6 {Defending the pawn on e4}
23.Nf1 {The Knight will go to e3 and create a blockade}
23...Bd5 {Another Bishop move. 23...Qd6 looks more human with the option of swinging the Queen to the Kingside later.}
24.Ne3 {As planned}
24...h6 {Vacating the h7 square for the Knight. Black prefers to wait in this solid position}
25.Qg3 {White prepares Nf5 with mate on g7}
25...Rc6 {Preparing ...Rg6 to nullify White's Queen on the g-file}
26.f5 {Controlling the g6 square}
26...Nh7 {Another defender activated}
27.Ng4 {The Knight can jump t e5 with this move}
27...Qg5 {The Queen controls the g-file and prevents Ne5.Also ...Qxf5 is threatened to nullify the White attack}
28.Qf2 {Protecting the f5 pawn with the Queen
28.Rf1 ?? 28...h5 wins for Black!}
28...Qd8 {The Queen goes back and waits}
29.Qg3 a5 {Black is not interested in a draw}

30...Ra6 {A passive Rook move that does not leave the sixth rank}
31.Rc1 {Rf1 is not possible as ...Bc4 wins the exchange}
31...Kh8 {Waiting move again as Black gets passive}
32.Ne5 {Increasing its influence in the centre}
32..Nf6 {The Knight is out for active defence}
33.Be1  {The Bishop vacates the c5 square for the Rook on c1 t increase the pressure on the a5 pawn}
33...Kh7 {Again waiting as Black is inconclusive with progress}
34.Kh2 {Another waiting move, this time from White!}
34...Qd6 {The Queen is out on d6 and ready for a Queen-side defence if White wants to push Rc5 at some point}
35.Qa3 {Offers to exchange Queens.White's draw offer agreed}1/2-1/2

1.e4 {The King pawn opening considered to be the oldest opening move by many}
1...g6 {Black goes for the complicated and swashbuckling Modern defence.}
2.d4 {When presented with an opportunity grab the centre with both hands. White's most common response in the Modern.}
2...Bg7 {The matador Bishop will attack on the a1-h8 diagonal. Black's plans include playing ...d6 followed by ...e5 or ...c5 to stake a claim in the centre.}
3.Nf3 {The classical line where White is contend to develop pieces. 3.f4 allows White to go for the brutal Austrian attack}
3...d6 {Preventing e5 and preparing ...Nf6}
4.Bd3 {A quiet move where White will probably castle next. 4.h3!? is also possible where White takes away the g4 square for the Black Bishop on c8.}
4...Nf6 {Transposing into the Pirc defense.}
5.O-O {White could have still played 5.h3!? or even 5.c4}
5...Nbd7 {A slow line where Black prepares the ...e5 thrust in the centre forcing White to make a decision. This move on the other hand blocks the Queen's vigil of the
d-file allowing White to push e5 himself.}
6.e5 {White grabs the opportunity to expand in the centre and gains space.}
6...dxe5 {Forced as the Knight was attacked}
7.dxe5 {Reinforcement in equal measure}
7...Nd5 {7...Ng4 also looks okay with a triple attack on the e5 pawn. 8.e6! forcing Black to have a dubious pawn structure.
8...fxe6 9.Qe2 attacking the pawn on e6.Now Black cannot O-O as Qxe6 comes with check, 9...c6. This move vacates the c7 square for the Queen.10.Rd1 Qc7 and the position is playable for Black}
8.Re1 {Protecting the wedge pawn on e5 and threatening Bxg6 followed by Qxd5 winning back the piece.}
8...c6 {A necessary move to prevent 9.Bxg6. The Knight on d5 gets added protection}
9.Bc4 {Attacking the Knight again and White threatens to win a pawn after Bxd5 on the next move.Again Black is forced to defend the Knight and go for a delayed castling.}
9...Nc5 {The Queen protects the Knight on d5 as the Knight on d7 vacates the e6 square for the Bishop on c8 to join the party}
10.Qd4 {The Queen is ready to swing to h4. Now the Black Knight has to move back again}
10...Ne6 {Attacking the Queen}
11.Qh4 {The Queen comes to h4 as planned and White is ready for Bh6 and exchange the Bishops weakening the dark squares in the Black camp}
11...h6 {The g5 square is taken out for the moment as Black cannot castle short any time soon}
12.Nc3 {White develops the Knight but he is willing to damage his pawn structure in the process.12.Bd2 looks more solid in my opinion.}
12...Nxc3 {12...Nb6 does not look a prudent choice.13.Bb3 Nc5 14.Be3 and has a tremendous lead in development with a clear edge. 12...g5 is also
a poor choice as 13.Qh5 allows White to lord the light-squared weaknesses on the Kingside.The Black King will then remain precariously
placed in the centre of the board for a while. 13...b5 14.Bb3 and White is nicely placed here.}
13.bxc3 Qa5 {The Queen attacks the c3 pawn as a countermeasure as Black's pieces are still tied up}
14.Qe4 {For some strange reason,White centralises the Queen again.14.Bd2 or 14.Rb1 look better.Perhaps White was banking on 14...Qxc3?
15.Bd1! Qa3 16.Nh4 O-O 17.Nxg6 and Black's position falls apart}
14...Nc5 {Attacking the Queen with tempo. This move also vacates the e6 square for the Bishop on c8.}
15.Qe3 {The Queen protects the pawn on c3 but another Queen move dilutes WHite's initiative}
15...Be6 {Meanwhile,Black develops the Bishop and is asking for an exchange of the Bishops}
16.Bf1 {The Bishop goes back as 16.Bxe6 Nxe6 throws the advantage out of the window}
16...Nd7 {Another Knight move from Black. This moves prepares ...Nb6 in case White pushes for Rb1 at some stage.Also the move
adds another attacker on the crucial e5 pawn. White's plausible plan is to play Nd4 followed by f4 which wills give him a firm grip on the centre.
16...Na4 looking to grab the c3 pawn looks a greedy proposition. 17.c4! solves White's problem
and the Knight on a4 looks a dumb piece}
17.a4 {The Bishop is ready to come to a3 and White wants to exploit the fact that the Black King is still stuck on e8. The Bishop will
pressurise the e7 pawn from a3.}
17...c5 {Numbing the e7-a3 diagonal. 17...Nb6 is also possible. 18.Ba3 Nc4 19.Bxc4 Bxc4 20.h4 and White can look forward to a Kingside
expansion.17...Nb6 is a classic example of playing another Knight move and two moves later that Knight is exchanged off. Black does have the Bishop pair but the
downside is that the King is stuck on e8.}
18.Bd3 {White does not develop the dark-squared Bishop but pressurises the weak g6 pawn instead.}
18...O-O {It is okay to castle mow as White is non-commital}
19.c4 {White vlears the d2-a5 diagonal for the Bishop. Also the b2-e5 diagonal will be strengthened if White decides to play Bb2}
19...Rfd8 {The f8 square is vacated for the Knight if WHite still decides to go for the Kingside initiative.}
20.h4 {White decides to go for it}
20...Qa6 {Black pressurises the c4 pawn again and looking forward to a counterplay on the Queenside}
21.Ra3 {This move lays a subtle trap wherein the pawn on c4 is poisoned. 21...Bxc4?? 22.e6! and the pawn on e6 will force Black to play 22...fxe6 23.Bxg6 and White
will breakthrough}
21...Rac8 {Preventing Qxc5 and also  preparing ...Nf8}
22.h5 {Attacking the vulnerable g6 pawn}
22...Nf8 {As planned}
23.Nd2 {Prepares Ne4 to attack the c5 pawn}
23...Bf5 {Offers to exchange Bishops.Also the e6 square is vacated for the Knight to protect the c5 pawn if required}
24.f4 {White expands on the King side as the Ne4 idea can easily be countered}
24...Ne6 {Planning ...Nd4 to cement the Knight in the centre}
25.Ne4 {Attacking the c5 pawn with another piece. Perhaps a tad better option was to play 25.Bb2 and control the d4 square}
25...Qc6 {The Queen can go to d7 if required}
26.a5 {Gaining space on the Queenside as White plays on both sides of the board}
26...Rd7 {Preparing ...Rcd8 to increase influence on the d4 square. 26...Nd4 invites 27.c3 which will force the Knight to
retreat back and White gains control of the d4 square}
27.Bb2 {White develops the Bishop and adds more control to the d4 square}
27...Nd4 {The Knight goes to d4 as planned}
28.Bxd4 {The Knight is removed as the dark-squared Bishop has little else to do other than removing Black's key defender}
28...Rxd4 {28...cxd4 looks weaker as it closes the d-file, the only active file for the Black Rooks.The Rook on d4 has an
indirect eye on the f4 pawn as well.}
29.hxg6 {The job of the h-pawn is done.}
29...fxg6 {29...Bxg6? is bad as the Bishop control of the f5 square. 30.Qh3!? followed by f5 will squeeze Black}
30.Nc3 {Looking to grab the d5 square and create more space issues for Black.The pawn on e7 is a potential target for the Knight on the
d5 square}
30...Bxd3 {Eliminating White's white squares 'boss'. The Bishop on f5 cannot afford to leave the f5 square and decides to go for an exchange to ease
pressure on the White squares}
31.cxd3 {The c-pawn now becomes a better d-pawn. The closed structure and the Knight versus Bishop battle gives White a great space
advantage at the moment.}
31...Rf8 {Attacking the f4 pawn. 31...Rcd8 attacking the pawn on d3 is not a good choice as 32.Nb5! spoils the show for Black.
32..R4d7 33.Nxa7 Qe6 34.Qxc5 and White has the initiative after gobbling two pawns}
32.Rf1 {The Rook is brought back to defend the pawn}
32...g5 {Attacking the f4 pawn}
33.f5 {33.fxg4 }
33...Qd7 {Adding second attacker to the d3 pawn}
34.Nd5 {Blocking the Rook on d4 and cutting off the Queen}
34...Rxd5 35.cxd5 Qxd5* {Black looks to fight with a pawn down}
