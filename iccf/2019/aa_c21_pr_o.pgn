1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6  {The Indian defence wherein centre control happens using as piece instead of occupying the central squares. Here the Knight controls the d5 and e4 squares }

2.c4 {The flank pawn controls the d5 square as White gains more space on the Queenside. The most popular theoretical move along with 2.Nf3}

2...e6 {Black releases the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop and also controls the d5 square}

3.g3 {White commits a fianchetto on g2 for the Bishop on f1 later and this is the Catalan}

3...d5 {Black stakes his claim in the centre}

4.Nf3 {Normal development where White will play Bg2 and O-O later}

4...Bb4+ {Borrowing an idea from the Bogo-Indian territory with this check. I believe Black has got the move order wrong.
After playing ...d5 earlier this check does not sound good because by playing ...d5 Black has lost some flexibility. }

5.Bd2 {5.Nbd2 is not great as 5...dxc4 gives Black a pleasant game. The Knight on d2 makes development harder for White and hence this Bishop move is the best
continuation}

5...Be7 { By performing this two-step Bishop dance Black has created a misplaced Bishop on d2 for White. }

6.Bg2 {White wants to complete castling on the next move}

6...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development}

7.O-O {White too follows suit}

7...c6 {Another good move as Black does not want any hiccups on the g2-b7 diagonal.
7...dxc4 hardly looks good as Black has played two moves with his Bishop already. }

8.Qc2 {White remains flexible as the pawn on c4 is now guarded.}

8...Nbd7 {Black plays another solid move}

9.Bf4 {Redirecting the Bishop on the f4-b8 diagonal}

9...b6 {Planning ...Bb7 or ...Ba6}

10.Rd1 {A theoretical move that looks awkward. The e1 square is kept vacant for the Knight while the c1 square is left vacant for the Bishop if Black attacks it with ...Nh5}

10...Ba6 {Threatening ...Bxc4 on the next move}

11.Ne5 {An active move that not only supports the pawn on c4 but also threatens the c6 pawn}

11...Rc8 {Protecting the c6 pawn. 11...Nxe5 is considered to be the main continuation}

12.cxd5 {Going for a pawn swap. 12.Nc3 is also a good choice where Black will give up the Bishop pair after 12...Bxc4 13.Nxc4 dxc4 in return for an extra pawn}

12...cxd5 {opening up the c-file for the Rook}

13.Nc6 {Attacking the Bishop on e7 which has nowhere to escape}

13...Nh5 {Black too wants to eliminate the Biahop pair}

14.Be3 {14.Bc1 is also okay allowing White a chance to push e4 at some point. The move blocka the idea e2-e4 but keeps the c1 square vacant for the
Rook on a1. White has to go for some trade-off}

14...Nb8 {Attacking the pinned Knight}

15.Nxe7+ {15.Nxd8?? Rxc2 and the White Knight on d8 will also be lost}

15...Qxe7 16.Nc3 {The Rook's attack on the Queen is blocked}

16...Nc6 {The Knight is back on a useful square}

17.g4 {Gaining space on the Kingside and attacking the Knight}

17...Nf6 18.h3 {Strengthening the pawn complex}

18...Na5 {Black wants to grab the c4 square and control the Queenside}

19.Bg5 {Anticipating an attack on the Bishop on e3 after Black plays ...Nc4, White pins the Knight on f6 and cranks up the pressure on the Kingside}

19...h6 {Putting the question to the Bishop}

20.Bh4 {Maintaing the pin}

20...b5 {Preparing ...b4 and win the pinned Knight on c3}

21.a3 {Preventing ...b4}

21...Bb7 {The Bishop is back to b7 and Black prepares for ...a6}

22.Qd3 {Unpinning the Knight on c3 and also attacking the pawn on b5}

22...Nc4 {Blocking the Queen's attack and attacking the b2 pawn. ...Nxb2 will allow a fork at the moment}

23.Rdc1 {The b2 pawn is left hanging as White can play Qxb5 anyway}

23...a6 {Black supports the b5 pawn and is now ready for ...Nxb2}

24.Rc2 {Protecting the pawn on b2}

24...g5 {Attacking the Bishop and starting a flank attack}
25.Bg3 h5 {Black expands on the Kingside }
26.e4 {White plays in the centre.}
26...dxe4 27.Nxe4 Bxe4 28.Bxe4 Nxe4 29.Qxe4 hxg4 {Black trades heavily and reaches and equal position}
30.hxg4 {30.Qxg4 f5! 31.Qe2 f4! and Black obtains great counterplay}
30...Nd6 {The Queen is atta again}
31.Qd3 {An equal game}
31...Rxc2 {Draw agreed by White}1/2-1/2

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...g6 {Black is ready for the Modern defence after 2.e4}

2.c4 {White want to go for the King's Indian setup instead}

2...Bg7 {Black allows White to create a massive pawn centre. But White needs to be careful as this pawn mass may come under attack later. A healthy balance of pawn moves along with
piece development is required in any opening}

3.e4 {White goes for the gauntlet and sets up a big centre}

3...c5 {Attacking the centre with a flank pawn. Now White is forced to make a decision of persisting with the same formation by playing Nf3 or alter it with
pushing d5. White can also play the dubious looking dxc5 where his centre and then suffer its consequences}

4.d5 {White creates a light-squared complex by playing the fourth consecutive pawn move!}

4...d6 {Black prevents WHite from pushing ...e5 and opens up the diagonal for the Bishop on c8}

5.Bd3 {White keeps the e2 square vacant for the Knight on g1. 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bg4 and then 6.Be2 will allow Black to trade the Bishop for the Knight
In this closed setup White wants to have more pieces on the board and increase Black's headaches.}

5...Nf6 {Black gets ready to O-O}

6.Nc3 {Developing the Queenside pieces further and the game now transposes into a Benoni}

6...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development}

7.Nf3 {White does not worry ...7.Bg4 as 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 wins the Bishop pair for White}

7...Na6 {Black keeps the option of playing ...Bg4 and plans to play ...Nc7,...Rb8,...a6 and ...b5. Black is aiming for a slow Queenside expansion.}

8.h3 {Denying Black the chance to play ...Bg4. Also White can play Be3 and Black will not be able to play ...Ng4 threatening to grab White's strong dark-squared Bishop}

8...e5 {Black closes the centre rendering the pawn on d6 backward. The bishop on g7 also loses its tenacity as its diagonal is blocked}

9.O-O {White too completes his development. 9.a3 is also possible where White denies the b4 square for the Knight on a6 but I feel that it is overtly positional}

9...Nc7 {Nice move as the Knight goes back to control the b5 square.
Moves like ...Bd7,...Rb8,...a6,...Qe8 are on the cards for a possible expansion on the Queenside. This plan is slow. Black could have opted for
9...Ne8 with ideas like ...f5 aiding a Kingside expansion.
9...Nb4?! looks bad after 10.Bb1 Ne8 11.a3 and the Knight is kicked back again}

10.a3 {10.Bg5 and pinning the Knight is also a good option. But then 10...Qe8 with more control over the b5 square not only unpins the Knight on f6 but also aids Black's idea
of a Queenside expansion. The move played announces White's intentions of being the first player to eye a Queenside expansion with moves like Rb1 and b4 up next}

10...Nh5!? {Interesting move. Black goes for a Kingside expansion. The pawn push ...f5 is prepared and ...Nf4 is too on the cards.}

11.Rb1 {White prepares a Queenside expansion with b2-b4 next}

11...Nf4 {Looks premature to me. It is important for Black to balance his Kingside expansion with moves that prevents White from carrying out his Queenside
expansion. 11...a5 was an apt choice that stops White from pushing b4}

12.Bxf4 {The pesky Knight is removed. 13.Bc2 retreating the Bishop also is a good choice but then this again allows Black to push ...a5 and make life difficult for White.
12.b4 was also possible immediately but then 12...Nxd3 13.Qxd3 b6 seems okay for Black}

12...exf4  {Forced recapture}

13.Qd2 {Attacking the pawn on f4. This move keeps Black busy in taking countermeasures and denying him the chance to push ...a5}

13...g5 {Interesting move. Black supports his pawn on f4 and decides to create a wedge on the f4 square}

14.Rfe1 {White can no longer push b4 with advantage.Earlier when the centre was closed with the White pawns on c4-d5-e4 and the Black pawns on c5-d6-e5, the Bishop on g7 was
placid. But now after the change in the pawn structure, the Bishop on g7 is alive and controls the c3 square. 14.b4? would lead into
14...cxb4 15.axb4 h5 and Black look to play ...g4 as well with activity on the Kingside. The move played comes with the idea of pushing e5 and after ...dxe5 White has a protected passed pawn on d5}

14...Ne8?! {Black improves the position of the Knight and it is clear that he wants it to be on f6. But is it the right time to improve the piece activity?
Black could have opted for active prophylaxis like 14...a5 and quell White's Queenside expansion plans.}

15.e5! {White continues with his changed scheme. By trying to open up the centre, White aims to exploit Black's lack of coordination amongst the pieces.
By removing the pawn on d6, White gives himself a great chance of creating a strong passed pawn candidate on d5}

15...dxe5 {Almost forced. 15...Bxe5 looks amateurish as the only active piece for Black would go back to the box}

16.Nxe5 {16.b4! was possible for White now giving up a pawn in the quest for Queenside expansion. The Black pawn on e5 would have cut off the diagonal for the
Bishop on g7 making b4 possible. Remember, this was the original idea which got busted due to Black's eccentricities.}

16...a5 {At last, Black prevents b4!}

17.Re2 {White wants to double the Rooks on the e-file as the plan on the Queenside has been stalled }

17...Nd6 {The Knight comes on the central square and Black wishes to push ...f5}

18.Rbe1 {The central e-file is now controlled by White's Rooks}

18...h6?! {Another questionable move.18...Bf5 challenging White's Bishop on d3 was perhaps a viable option }

19.Nb5! {Challenging the Knight on d6 because the blockader blocks the advance of the pawn on d5}

19...Ra6!? {Good defence. The Rook comes out to move to d6 if the Kn9ights are exchanged. Black sheds his passivity}

20.Bb1 {Improving the Bishop's position and preparing Qc2 and Qh7#}

20...h5 {Black does not commit ...f5 and waits for White to respond with his Queen}

21.a4 {No commitment from White either as White sees that Qc2 or Qd3 is futile as Black has the potent response 21...Bf5!
This subtle pawn push also fixes Black's pawn on the a5 square and the White Queen eyes it from d2.}

21...f5 {Another pawn advance, this time the h7 square is cut-off from White's control}

22.b3 {Strengthening the pawn complex on the Queenside. White waits for Black to take up the gauntlet on the Kingside}

22...Nxb5 {Black trades Knights. What else is there to play?}

23.axb5 {23.cxb5 is bad as the pawn on d5 will become isolated}

23...Rd6 {The Rook is the new blockader of the passed pawn on d5.Another move worth considering was to play 23...Rh6 with moves like ...g4 and ...h4 on the cards}

24.h4 {White now turns his focus on the Kingside as the Queenside expansion has attained it's objective. The move played attacks the defender of the
f4 pawn. It also stops Black from playing ...h4 himself}

24...g4? {Black makes a mistake. Better was 24...Bh6 25.hxg5 Bxg5 and Black can carry on fighting}

25.Qxf4 {Black's fragile pawn structure will be a liability as the game continues}

25...Bh6 {Good move to attack the Queen}

26.Qh2 {The Queen is not only safew but also guards the pawn on h4}

26...f4?! {Another pawn advance but can Black afford to do it in this precarious situation. 26...Rf6 followed by ..f4 was perhaps the right way to go about it}

27.Bg6 {The h5 pawn is under pressure and Black will slowly but surely start losing the pawn cover on the Kingside.}

27...Qf6 {27...Bg7 is perhaps neccessary to dislodge the Knight on e5 after ...Bxe5}

28.Bxh5 {Another pawn lost and Black's position is crumbling}

28...Qg7 {Protecting the pawn on g4 for the second time and Black's pieces have donned a passive look}

29.f3 {Challenging Black's pawn on g4, White wants to open up the f and g-files against the Black King}

29...g3 {Attacking the Queen and keeping the g-file closed}

30.Qh1 {Forced}

30...Qh8 {Both the Queens occupy the edge of the board!}

31.Bg4 {Offering to trade Bishops and inch closer to a lighter game}

31...Bg7 {Black attacks the nemesis on e5}

32.Bxc8 {Trading the Bishop as White liquidates}

32...Rxc8 33.Qh3 {The Queen comes out of the hood and attacks the Rook}
33...Rcd8 {Doubling forces on the d-file, Black remains passive}

34.Qg4 {Pinning the Bishop on g7. Qxf4 is a threat that Black needs to address or else the g3 pawn will also fall leading to a winning game for White}

34...Qh6 {Protecting the f4 pawn}

35.h5 {White has plenty of waiting moves.35.Re4 is another way of piling up on the f4 pawn}

35...Rf8 {Black's pieces are stuck defending the weak pawn infrastructure}

36.Kf1 {Another waiting move!}

36...Kh7 {The Bishop on g7 is now alive and kicking}

37.Ng6 {Attacking the Rook on f8. 37.Nd3 is also good as the c5 pawn will be under fire. 37...b6 38.Re6 Rxe6 39.dxe6 and White has created a strong passed pawn with Black in a bind}

37...Rxg6 {The best plan for Black. The Knight would have come to h4 and then threaten to attck the Queen with Nf5. 37...R8f6 38.Re6 also does nothing for Black}

38.Qxg6+ {Exchanging Queens is the best way to enter into a winning endgame}
38...Qxg6 39.hxg6 Kxg6 40.Re8 {Offering to trade Rooks now}
40...Rf5 {Black declines the trade and rightly so}
41.d6 {Passed pawns is pushed further}
41...Rf7 {Preventing d7}
42.R1e7 {Offering to trade Rooks}
42...Bf6 {What else?}
43.Rg8+ {Forcing exchange of all the pieces on board and Queening on d8 soon afterwards}
43...Bg7 44.Rxf7 Kxf7 45.Rxg7+ Kxg7 46.d7 {White will bring a Queen on the next move and should win easily.Black resigned}1-0

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...d5 {The Queen pawn game where Black replies in identical fashion}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit where Black offers a flank pawn to gain central control}

2...e6 {The Queen's gambit declined. 2...c6 leads to the Slav defence}

3.Nc3 {More control over the d5 and e4 squares as White develops a piece}

3...Nf6 {Controlling the d5 and e4 squares}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {I believe people should explore 4...Nxd5 as it does not allow White to get an annoying pin as happens in this game}

5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation where White pins the Knight and puts more pressure on the d5 pawn}

5...Nc6?! {I would not call it a great move although it develops a piece. 5...c6 was much better. This Knight blocks the pawn on c7 from occupying the c5 square.
Black's Queenside expansion is hindered because of this Knight on c6}

6.e3 {White continues with his plan of placing the Bishop on d3 or e2}

6...Be7 {Unpinning the Knight and gets ready to O-O}

7.Bd3 {THe Bishop is placed on a healthy diagonal}

7...Nb4 {Attacking the menacing Bishop}

8.Bb1 {The Bishop goes back but the effect on the long diagonal remains. The Knight will be kicked back after White pushes a3. Black will have lost a move without gaining anything}

8...O-O {A logical move that completes Black's Kingside development}

9.a3 {Kicking the Knight back and preparing a Queenside expansion later with b4}

9...Nc6?! {A slight mistake as this natural looking retreat allows White to win a pawn. 9...Na6!? was better as Black can play c7-c5 later to grab some space in the centre}

10.Bxf6 {Eliminating the defender of the h7 and the d5 pawns. }

10...Bxf6 {Forced or else 10...gxf6?? not only damages Black's pawn structure but also gives White a winning edge. 11.Qh5! threatening mate on h7
11...f5  to block the Bishop's vigilance from b1. 12. g4 distracting the pawn again! 12...f6 13.gxf5 opening up the g-file for the Rook to come into play
and White can carry out a mating attack against the Black King}

11.Qh5 {Threatening mate on h7 and also a double attack on the d5 pawn}

11...Be6?? {What an unbelievable blunder in a correspondence game of chess!! }

12.Qxh7# {Checkmate!}1-0

2.c4 {White gains space on the Queenside and controls the d5 square.}

2...e6 {Frees the diagonal for the Bishop on f8}

3.Nf3 {White does not want a Nimzo-Indian defence after 2.Nc3 Bb4}

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian defence}

4.Bd2 {White wants to exchange Bishops. 3.Nbd2 is considered passive but playable}

4...Qe7 {3...a5 is also playable. The move played in the game is called the Nimzowitsch variation of the Bogo-Indian}

5.g3 {The best continuation as White wants to rule the diagonal h1-a8 with the Bishop}

5...Nc6 {Attacking the central pawn d4}

6.e3 {A questionable move that overprotects the pawn on d4. The pawn on d4 was never under serious threat}

6...O-O {Black completes the Kingside development}

7.Bg2 {White develops the Bishop and prepares O-O}

7...Bxd2+ {Trading the Bishops and removing the dark-squared movers from the board}

8.Nfxd2!? {An interesting choice. 8.Nbxd2 looked better as another piece would also have been developed but White wants the Bishop on the active diagonal while the other Knight will
go to the c3 square}

8...e5 {Asking White to commit his central d4 pawn to d5 or exchange with dxe5}

9.d5 {White decides to keep the centre closed}

9...Nb8 {The Knight will come back to d7 after Black plays ...d6}

10.Nc3 {White develops another Knight}

10...d6 {Black solidifies the pawn structure and opens up the diagonal for the Bishop Black's fianchetto idea on b7 is a non-starter as White's pawn on d5
spoils the show for the Bishop on b7.Hence ...b6 is ruled out}

11.a3 {White prepares b4.Another slow move. 11.O-O looks more natural}

11...a5 {Gains space on the Queenside although White can still play b4}

12.Qc2 {Making it harder for Black to develop the light-squared Bishop to f5}

12...Na6 {The Knight is willing to jump on the c5 square later adding more control over the e4 square}

13.b3 {White makes another pawn move and simply reinforces the pawn on c4}

13...Ne8 {With plans of pushing ...f5 next and gaining space on the Kingside.}

14.e4 {White cements the central pawn on e4 and this has been an odd game so far from White}

14...f5 {Black expands on the Kingside as planned}

15.exf5 Bxf5 {Attacking the Queen}

16.Be4 {White wants to trade his bad Bishop}

1.e4  {The King pawn opening which not only occupies the d5 and f5 squares but also releaases the King's Bishop on f1. }

1...e6 {The French defence is on the board as Black wants to fight for the central squares by occupying the d5 square on the next move as a response to White's
King pawn opening.}

2.e5 {The Steinitz attack begins as White gains more space and will play on the Kingside}

2...d5 {Black occupies the d5 square and controls the c4 and e4 squares in the enemy camp}

3.d4  {Transposing into the advanced variation of the French defence. White has fixed his pawn structure on the dark squares d4 and e5.
This is the main aim of the French defence for Black as he has successfully managed to provoke White from pushing his King pawn further.}

3...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain as Black gains more space on the Queenside and threatens to dismantle White's central pawn chain. This
is the main motif in the advanced variation where Black will target White's d4 pawn regularly.}

4.c3 {White reinforces the support to the d4 pawn but denies the c3 square to the Knight on b1}

4...Qb6 {An excellent Queen move that adds more pressure on the d4 pawn. Also by putting pressure on the b2 pawn Black stops White from responding Be3}

5.Nf3 {Development and also protecting the d4 pawn}

5...Nc6 {Standard theory that not only develops a piece but also adds another attacker to the d4 pawn}

6.Be3?? {What a mistake! The Queen on b6 will now gobble up the pawn on b2}

6...Qxb2 {White will lose at least two pawns as the Rook on a1 is threatened along with the pawn on c3}

7.Nbd2 {Protecting the Rook.}

7...c4! {Fixing the c3 pawn and hindering development of the Bishop on f1. 7...Qxc3 was also possible
But then 8.dxc5 followed by Rc1 allows White to save a pawn. This move does not allow the possibility of dxc5 also.}

8.Rc1 {Protecting the c3 pawn. It looks as if 8.Qc1 does the job for White in saving the loss of another pawn.
But then 8...Ba3! with a double attack on the Queen does not save White from losing another pawn.
9.Qxb2 Bxb2 10.Rb1 Bxc3 and Black is up two pawns}

8...Qxa2 {Easy pickings for Black as the passed pawn on a7 can be pushed later}

9.Be2 {White prepares O-O}

9...Nge7 {Black could have also played ...b5 followed by ...a5 and ...Rb8 to steamroll White}

10.O-O {White completes Kingside development}

10...Nf5 {Going after the dark-squared Bishop and also vacating the e7 square for the Bishop on f8.Black can simply trade off all pieces and enter into a
winning endgame}

11.Rc2 {Attacking the Queen again}

11...Qa5 {The Queen can go back to d8 and remain safe. 11...Nxe3? is a bad idea 12. fxe3 with an attack on the f7 pawn from the Rook on f1
12...Qa3 13.Ng5 attacking the f7 pawn again and Black will lose a pawn}

12.Bf4 {Protecting the Bishop as simplification of any kind brings White closer to defeat}

12...b5 {Black wants to ensure that the passed a-pawn will march to the Queening square. This is a preparatory move in that quest. Black
plans to play ...Qb6,...Rb8 and ...a5 and then start rolling the pawns on the a and the b-files}

13.Qb1 {13.g4 was a better move as White could have gained space on the Kingside where he is stronger. The move played seems to be a waiting move with no concrete
plan}

13...Rb8 {Adding more protection to the b5 pawn. Now Black can pull back the Queen to the c7 square and then push ...a5 and keep expanding on the Queenside}

14.Ng5?! {A tepid move not amounbting to anything. The Knight has nothing significant to do from the g5 square}

14...h6 {Kicking the Knight and controlling the g5 square for good}

15.Nxf7?? {What is this? Sacrificial attack maybe.}

15...Kxf7 {The King grabs the Knight and waits for a confrontation}

16.Ra2? {16.Bh5+ was expected but White plays on the Queenside leaving the pawn on c3 hanging}

16...Qxc3 {Grab the free material and hope for an early finish}

17.g4 {White is going berserk here}

17...Nfxd4 {Another pawn grabbed for free}

18.Qd1 {The Bishop on e2 is protected. What else are White's chances of prolonging the inevitable?}

18...Nxe2 {Trading pieces and making White's life difficult}

19.Qxe2 b4 {Passed pawn is meant to be pushed}

20.g5 {Vacating the h5 square for his Queen}

20...hxg5 {The h5 square is now controlled by the Rook}

21.Bxg5 b3 {The Queenside expansion continues and the Rook on a2 comes under fire}

22.Nb1? {Bad choice. White attacks the Black Queen instead of protecting the Rook}

22...Qh3! {Threatening checkmate on h2! Now the Rook on a2 will have to go and White is looking down and out! White resigned}0-1

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6  {The Indian defence wherein centre control happens using as piece instead of occupying the central squares. Here the Knight controls the d5 and e4 squares }

2.Nf3 {A solid move. 2.c4 is also popular which gains space on the Queenside}

2...e6 {Black opens up the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop}

3.c4 {Transposing into the Anti-Nimzo where Black plays 3.Nf3 after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 hoping to avoid the Nimzo-Indian defence considered to be the best response for Black }

3...Bb4+ {The Bogo-Indian defence}

4.Bd2 {4.Nbd2 is also played but slightly passive. Here White does not mind exchanging the dark-squared Bishops}

4...Qe7 {The Nimzowitsch variation.}

5.g3 {The main move where White wants to control the g2-a8 diagonal}

5...Nc6 {The Knight puts pressure on the d4 pawn}

6.Bg2 {A natural continuation and White commits the Bishop on the long diagonal}

6...Bxd2+ {Black releases the tension. Standard theory}

7.Qxd2 {A weak recapture. Better was 7.Nbxd2. Now Black attacks the Queen's by occupying the e4 square}

7...Ne4 {Attacking the Queen as Black thrusts the Knight on the central e square}

8.Qc2 {Losing another tempo with the Queen}

8...Qb4+ {Forcing White to take a decision. White can lose castling rights or else will have a damaged pawn structure to avert the check}

9.Nc3 {White could have tried 9.Kd1 d5 losing castling rights but keeping the pawn structure intact.}

9...Nxc3 {Black wants to damgae the pawn structure and have a better endgame where the doubled pawns will come back to haunt White}

10.bxc3 {White sacrifices a pawn instead and aims for activity with the Queens on the board}

10...Qxc4 {Black grabs a pawn and is perfectly alright here although this is the third Queen move already!}

11.O-O O-O {Both sides take their Kings to safety}

12.Rfd1 {12.e4 was a nice possibility for White}

12...d6 {Planning ...e5 at some point}

13.e3  {Strengthening the d4 pawn}

13...h6 {14.Ng5 is prevented for the moment.
13...Qb5 was also a good idea redirecting it to h5 for a possible Kingside expansion.}
14.Rab1 {White brings out the Rook on a semi-open file}
14...a5 {Taking away the b4 square}
15.Bf1 {The Queen is attacked and has to move again}
15...Qd5 {The only square where the Queen is safe}
16.Nh4 {17.Bg2 is the idea}
16...Qg5 {Black can run away with the Queen to e7 and remain a pawn up}
17.f4 {Attacking the Queen again}
17...Qe7 18.Bg2 {Preventing ...b6}
18...a4 {Gaining more space on the Queenside}
19.Re1 {Pushing e4 in the centre is a possible idea for White.19.e4 was much better}
19...Re8 {Activating the King Rook}
20.e4 {Grabbing the central square. White has some compensation for the lost pawn}
20...e5 {Challenging White's massive pawn structure}
21.Nf5 {Attacking the Queen, the Knight occupies more space in the White camp}
21...Qd8 {Back to the home square. 21...Qf6 is okay but then Rf1 followed by fxe5 will force the Queen another tempo
21...Qd7 is also similar.22.dxe5 dxe5 23.Rbd1 again forces a Queen move for Black.21...Qf8 is too safe a square for the Queen as she gets out of action.
Black will have to waste at least two tempi to get her back into action.}
22.dxe5 {White liquidates further and opens the centre}
22...dxe5 23.Ne3 {The Knight goes back and one possible plan is to open up the f-file with fxe5,Rf,Qf2 etc.}
23...Re6 {The Rook prepares to go to d6 followed by ...Rd2 and Black wants to dominate the d-file.}
24.Qf2 {White is targeting the f7 pawn after fxe5 and Rf1. This is a slow idea and Black has adequate resources to defend}
24...Rd6 {As planned, the Rook lift is on the board. The Rook can now swing to g6 if required. ...Rd2 is now a strong threat.}
25.f5?! {White was perhaps worried with the idea of facing ...exf4 leaving with the isolated pawn on e4 after Qxf4.
The move played takes away the g6 square from the Black Rook. But the move not only keeps the f-file closed but also }
25...Na5 {The pawn on b7 is now protected and Black now prepares ...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6. The Knight on a5 can jump to c4 at an opportune time.}
26.Qe2 {The Queen wants to go to the b5 square and grab the a4 pawn next.}
26...Bd7* {No entry on the b5 square!}
