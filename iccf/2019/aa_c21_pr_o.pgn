1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6  {The Indian defence wherein centre control happens using as piece instead of occupying the central squares. Here the Knight controls the d5 and e4 squares }

2.c4 {The flank pawn cothe d5 square as White gains more space on the Queenside. The most popular theoretical move along with 2.Nf3}

2...e6 {Black releases the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop and also controls the d5 square} 

3.g3 {White commits a fianchetto on g2 for the Bishop on f1 later and this is the Catalan}

3...d5 {Black stakes his claim in the centre}

4.Nf3 {Normal development where White will play Bg2 and O-O later}

4...Bb4+ {Borrowing an idea from the Bogo-Indian territory with this check. I believe Black has got the move order wrong. 
After playing ...d5 earlier this check does not sound good because by playing ...d5 Black has lost some flexibility. }

5.Bd2 {5.Nbd2 is not great as 5...dxc4 gives Black a pleasant game. The Knight on d2 makes development harder for White and hence this Bishop move is the best 
continuation}

5...Be7 { By performing this two-step Bishop dance Black has created a misplaced Bishop on d2 for White. }

6.Bg2 {White wants to complete castling on the next move}

6...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development}

7.O-O {White too follows suit}

7...c6 {Another good move as Black does not want any hiccups on the g2-b7 diagonal.
7...dxc4 hardly looks good as Black has played two moves with his Bishop already. }

8.Qc2* {White remains flexible as the pawn on c4 is now guarded.}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...g6 {Black is ready for the Modern defence after 2.e4}

2.c4 {White want to go for the King's Indian setup instead}

2...Bg7 {Black allows White to create a massive pawn centre. But White needs to be careful as this pawn mass may come under attack later. A healthy balance of pawn moves along with 
piece development is required in any opening}

3.e4 {White goes for the gauntlet and sets up a big centre}

3...c5 {Attacking the centre with a flank pawn. Now White is forced to make a decision of persisting with the same formation by playing Nf3 or alter it with 
pushing d5. White can also play the dubious looking dxc5 where his centre and then suffer its consequences}

4.d5 {White creates a light-squared complex by playing the fourth consecutive pawn move!}

4...d6 {Black prevents WHite from pushing ...e5 and opens up the diagonal for the Bishop on c8}

5.Bd3 {White keeps the e2 square vacant for the Knight on g1. 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bg4 and then 6.Be2 will allow Black to trade the Bishop for the Knight
In this closed setup White wants to have more pieces on the board and increase Black's headaches.}

5...Nf6 {Black gets ready to O-O}

6.Nc3 {Developing the Queenside pieces further and the game now transposes into a Benoni}

6...O-O {Black completes his Kingside development}

7.Nf3 {White does not worry ...7.Bg4 as 8.h3 Bxf3 9.Qxf3 wins the Bishop pair for White}

7...Na6 {Black keeps the option of playing ...Bg4 and plans to play ...Nc7,...Rb8,...a6 and ...b5. Black is aiming for a slow Queenside expansion.}

8.h3 {Denying Black the chance to play ...Bg4. Also White can play Be3 and Black will not be able to play ...Ng4 threatening to grab White's strong dark-squared Bishop}

8...e5 {Black closes the centre rendering the pawn on d6 backward. The bishop on g7 also loses its tenacity as its diagonal is blocked}

9.O-O {White too completes his development. 9.a3 is also possible where White denies the b4 square for the Knight on a6 but I feel that it is overtly positional}

9...Nc7 {Nice move as the Knight goes back to control the b5 square.
Moves like ...Bd7,...Rb8,...a6,...Qe8 are on the cards for a possible expansion on the Queenside. This plan is slow. Black could have opted for 
9...Ne8 with ideas like ...f5 aiding a Kingside expansion.
9...Nb4?! looks bad after 10.Bb1 Ne8 11.a3 and the Knight is kicked back again}

10.a3 {10.Bg5 and pinning the Knight is also a good option. But then 10...Qe8 with more control over the b5 square not only unpins the Knight on f6 but also aids Black's idea 
of a Queenside expansion. The move played announces White's intentions of being the first player to eye a Queenside expansion with moves like Rb1 and b4 up next}

10...Nh5!? {Interesting move. Black goes for a Kingside expansion. The pawn push ...f5 is prepared and ...Nf4 is too on the cards.}

11.Rb1 {White prepares a Queenside expansion with b2-b4 next}

11...Nf4 {Looks premature to me. It is important for Black to balance his Kingside expansion with moves that prevents White from carrying out his Queenside 
expansion. 11...a5 was an apt choice that stops White from pushing b4}

12.Bxf4 {The pesky Knight is removed. 13.Bc2 retreating the Bishop also is a good choice but then this again allows Black to push ...a5 and make life difficult for White.
12.b4 was also possible immediately but then 12...Nxd3 13.Qxd3 b6 seems okay for Black}

12...exf4  {Forced recapture}

13.Qd2 {Attacking the pawn on f4. This move keeps Black busy in taking countermeasures and denying him the chance to push ...a5}

13...g5* {Interesting move. Black supports his pawn on f4 and decides to create a wedge on the f4 square}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...d5 {The Queen pawn game where Black replies in identical fashion}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit where Black offers a flank pawn to gain central control}

2...e6 {The Queen's gambit declined. 2...c6 leads to the Slav defence}

3.Nc3 {More control over the d5 and e4 squares as White develops a piece}

3...Nf6 {Controlling the d5 and e4 squares}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {I believe people should explore 4...Nxd5 as it does not allow White to get an annoying pin as happens in this game}

5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation where White pins the Knight and puts more pressure on the d5 pawn}

5...Nc6?! {I would not call it a great move although it develops a piece. 5...c6 was much better. This Knight blocks the pawn on c7 from occupying the c5 square.
Black's Queenside expansion is hindered because of this Knight on c6}

6.e3 {White continues with his plan of placing the Bishop on d3 or e2}

6...Be7 {Unpinning the Knight and gets ready to O-O}

7.Bd3 {THe Bishop is placed on a healthy diagonal}

7...Nb4 {Attacking the menacing Bishop}

8.Bb1 {The Bishop goes back but the effect on the long diagonal remains. The Knight will be kicked back after White pushes a3. Black will have lost a move without gaining anything}

8...O-O {A logical move that completes Black's Kingside development}

9.a3 {Kicking the Knight back and preparing a Queenside expansion later with b4}

9...Nc6?! {A slight mistake as this natural looking retreat allows White to win a pawn. 9...Na6!? was better as Black can play c7-c5 later to grab some space in the centre}

10.Bxf6 {Eliminating the defender of the h7 and the d5 pawns. }

10...Bxf6 {Forced or else 10...gxf6?? not only damages Black's pawn structure but also gives White a winning edge. 11.Qh5! threatening mate on h7
11...f5  to block the Bishop's vigilance from b1. 12. g4 distracting the pawn again! 12...f6 13.gxf5 opening up the g-file for the Rook to come into play 
and White can carry out a mating attack against the Black King}

11.Qh5 {Threatening mate on h7 and also a double attack on the d5 pawn}

11...Be6?? {What an unbelievable blunder in a correspondence game of chess!! }

12.Qxh7# {Checkmate!}1-0

1.e4  {The King pawn opening which not only occupies the d5 and f5 squares but also releaases the King's Bishop on f1. }

1...e6 {The French defence is on the board as Black wants to fight for the central squares by occupying the d5 square on the next move as a response to White's
King pawn opening.}

2.e5 {The Steinitz attack begins as White gains more space and will play on the Kingside}

2...d5 {Black occupies the d5 square and controls the c4 and e4 squares in the enemy camp}

3.d4  {Transposing into the advanced variation of the French defence. White has fixed his pawn structure on the dark squares d4 and e5. 
This is the main aim of the French defence for Black as he has successfully managed to provoke White from pushing his King pawn further.}

3...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain as Black gains more space on the Queenside and threatens to dismantle White's central pawn chain. This
is the main motif in the advanced variation where Black will target White's d4 pawn regularly.}

4.c3 {White reinforces the support to the d4 pawn but denies the c3 square to the Knight on b1}

4...Qb6 {An excellent Queen move that adds more pressure on the d4 pawn. Also by putting pressure on the b2 pawn Black stops White from responding Be3}

5.Nf3 {Development and also protecting the d4 pawn}

5...Nc6 {Standard theory that not only develops a piece but also adds another attacker to the d4 pawn}

6.Be3?? {What a mistake! The Queen on b6 will now gobble up the pawn on b2}

6...Qxb2 {White will lose at least two pawns as the Rook on a1 is threatened along with the pawn on c3}

7.Nbd2 {Protecting the Rook.}

7...c4! {Fixing the c3 pawn and hindering development of the Bishop on f1. 7...Qxc3 was also possible 
But then 8.dxc5 followed by Rc1 allows White to save a pawn. This move does not allow the possibility of dxc5 also.}

8.Rc1 {Protecting the c3 pawn. It looks as if 8.Qc1 does the job for White in saving the loss of another pawn. 
But then 8...Ba3! with a double attack on the Queen does not save White from losing another pawn.
9.Qxb2 Bxb2 10.Rb1 Bxc3 and Black is up two pawns} 

8...Qxa2 {Easy pickings for Black as the passed pawn on a7 can be pushed later}

9.Be2 {White prepares O-O}

9...Nge7 {Black could have also played ...b5 followed by ...a5 and ...Rb8 to steamroll White}

10.O-O {White completes Kingside development}

10...Nf5 {Going after the dark-squared Bishop and also vacating the e7 square for the Bishop on f8.Black can simply trade off all pieces and enter into a 
winning endgame}

11.Rc2 {Attacking the Queen again}

11...Qa5 {The Queen can go back to d8 and remain safe. 11...Nxe3? is a bad idea 12. fxe3 with an attack on the f7 pawn from the Rook on f1
12...Qa3 13.Ng5 attacking the f7 pawn again and Black will lose a pawn}

12.Bf4 {Protecting the Bishop as simplification of any kind brings White closer to defeat}

12...b5 {Black wants to ensure that the passed a-pawn will march to the Queening square. This is a preparatory move in that quest. Black 
plans to play ...Qb6,...Rb8 and ...a5 and then start rolling the pawns on the a and the b-files}

13.Qb1 {13.g4 was a better move as White could have gained space on the Kingside where he is stronger. The move played seems to be a waiting move with no concrete 
plan}

13...Rb8 {Adding more protection to the b5 pawn. Now Black can pull back the Queen to the c7 square and then push ...a5 and keep expanding on the Queenside}

14.Ng5?! {A tepid move not amounbting to anything. The Knight has nothing significant to do from the g5 square}

14...h6 {Kicking the Knight and controlling the g5 square for good}

15.Nxf7?? {What is this? Sacrificial attack maybe.}

15...Kxf7 {The King grabs the Knight and waits for a confrontation}

16.Ra2? {16.Bh5+ was expected but White plays on the Queenside leaving the pawn on c3 hanging}

16...Qxc3 {Grab the free material and hope for an early finish}

17.g4 {White is going berserk here}

17...Nfxd4 {Another pawn grabbed for free}

18.Qd1 {The Bishop on e2 is protected. What else are White's chances of prolonging the inevitable?}

18...Nxe2 {Trading pieces and making White's life difficult}

19.Qxe2 b4 {Passed pawn is meant to be pushed}

20.g5 {Vacating the h5 square for his Queen}

20...hxg5 {The h5 square is now controlled by the Rook}

21.Bxg5 b3 {The Queenside expansion continues and the Rook on a2 comes under fire}

22.Nb1? {Bad choice. White attacks the Black Queen instead of protecting the Rook}

22...Qh3!* {Threatening checkmate on h2! Now the Rook on a2 will have to go and White is looking down and out!}
