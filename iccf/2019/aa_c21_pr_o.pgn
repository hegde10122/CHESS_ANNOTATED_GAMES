1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...Nf6  {The Indian defence wherein centre control happens using as piece instead of occupying the central squares. Here the Knight controls the d5 and e4 squares }

2.c4 {The flank pawn cothe d5 square as White gains more space on the Queenside. The most popular theoretical move along with 2.Nf3}

2...e6 {Black releases the diagonal for the dark-squared Bishop and also controls the d5 square} 

3.g3* {White gets into a fianchetto}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...g6 {Black is ready for the Modern defence after 2.e4}

2.c4 {White want to go for the King's Indian setup instead}

2...Bg7 {Black allows White to create a massive pawn centre. But White needs to be careful as this pawn mass may come under attack later. A healthy balance of pawn moves along with 
piece development is required in any opening}

3.e4 {White goes for the gauntlet and sets up a big centre}

3...c5 {Attacking the centre with a flank pawn. Now White is forced to make a decision of persisting with the same formation by playing Nf3 or alter it with 
pushing d5. White can also play the dubious looking dxc5 where his centre and then suffer its consequences}

4.d5* {White creates a light-squared complex by playing the fourth consecutive pawn move!}

1.d4 {The Queen pawn opening}

1...d5 {The Queen pawn game where Black replies in identical fashion}

2.c4 {The Queen's gambit where Black offers a flank pawn to gain central control}

2...e6 {The Queen's gambit declined. 2...c6 leads to the Slav defence}

3.Nc3 {More control over the d5 and e4 squares as White develops a piece}

3...Nf6 {Controlling the d5 and e4 squares}

4.cxd5 {The exchange variation}

4...exd5 {I believe people should explore 4...Nxd5 as it does not allow White to get an annoying pin as happens in this game}

5.Bg5 {The Carlsbad variation where White pins the Knight and puts more pressure on the d5 pawn}

5...Nc6?! {I would not call it a great move although it develops a piece. 5...c6 was much better. This Knight blocks the pawn on c7 from occupying the c5 square.
Black's Queenside expansion is hindered because of this Knight on c6}

6.e3 {White continues with his plan of placing the Bishop on d3 or e2}

6...Be7 {Unpinning the Knight and gets ready to O-O}

7.Bd3 {THe Bishop is placed on a healthy diagonal}

7...Nb4 {Attacking the menacing Bishop}

8.Bb1* {The Bishop goes back but the effect on the long diagonal remains. The Knight will be kicked back after White pushes a3. Black will have lost a move without gaining anything}

1.e4  {The King pawn opening which not only occupies the d5 and f5 squares but also releaases the King's Bishop on f1. }

1...e6 {The French defence is on the board as Black wants to fight for the central squares by occupying the d5 square on the next move as a response to White's
King pawn opening.}

2.e5 {The Steinitz attack begins as White gains more space and will play on the Kingside}

2...d5 {Black occupies the d5 square and controls the c4 and e4 squares in the enemy camp}

3.d4  {Transposing into the advanced variation of the French defence. White has fixed his pawn structure on the dark squares d4 and e5. 
This is the main aim of the French defence for Black as he has successfully managed to provoke White from pushing his King pawn further.}

3...c5 {Attacking the base of the pawn chain as Black gains more space on the Queenside and threatens to dismantle White's central pawn chain. This
is the main motif in the advanced variation where Black will target White's d4 pawn regularly.}

4.c3 {White reinforces the support to the d4 pawn but denies the c3 square to the Knight on b1}

4...Qb6 {An excellent Queen move that adds more pressure on the d4 pawn. Also by putting pressure on the b2 pawn Black stops White from responding Be3}

5.Nf3 {Development and also protecting the d4 pawn}

5...Nc6 {Standard theory that not only develops a piece but also adds another attacker to the d4 pawn}

6.Be3?? {What a mistake! The Queen on b6 will now gobble up the pawn on b2}

6...Qxb2* {White will lose at least two pawns as the Rook on a1 is threatened along with the pawn on c3}
